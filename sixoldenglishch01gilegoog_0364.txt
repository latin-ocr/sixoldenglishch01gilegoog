836 THE WORKE 01¹ (1111111, [Β ἢ

1110111111ου10, but their vanities have seduced them. A'nd 1
will send fire upon Judah, and it shall 001 the foundations 01
Jerusalem. Thus saith our Lord3 ln three grievous sins 01
101001, 0111 in four I will not convert them, for 11101 they have
sold the just 101 money, and the poor man for shoes, which
they tread upon the dust 01 the earth, and with buffets they
did beat the 110010 01 the poor, 0111 have eschewed the way
01 the humble” And 01101 0 few words, “Seelr our Lord
and ye shall live, that the house 01 Joseph may not shine us
110, 001 the flame devour it, and he shall not be, that can
extinguish it. The house 01 Israel hath hated him who re-
bulreth in the gates, and abhorred the upright word.” Which
Amos, being forbidden to prophesy in Israel, without any
fawning flattery, saith in answer, “ I was not 0 prophet, nor
yet the son 01 0 prophet, but 0 goatherd; I was pluckiug
sycamores and our Lord took me from my herd, 0111 001
Lord said unto me, Go thy way 001 prophesy against my
people 01 Israel: and now hear 11100 the 11011 01 001 Lord
(101 he directed his speech nnto the king), thou sayest, 10
not prophesy against Israel, and thou shalt not assemble
troops against the house 01 Jacob. For which cause 001
Lord saith thus, thy wife in the city shall play the 1101101,
end thy sons and daughters shall die by the swerd, and thy
ground be measured by the cord, and thou in 0 polluted land
01101100111111101101101101001, she shall be led from his
own country 0 captive.'’ And afterwards, “ Ηο01 therefore
these words, ye who 10 outrageously afflict the poor, 0111
practise your mighty power against the needy of the earth,
who say, when shall the month pass over that we may pur-
chase, and the sabbatha that we may open the treasuries.”
And within 0 1011 words after, “ 001 Lord doth swear against
the pride 01 Jacob, if he shall in contempt forget your ac·
tiens, and if in these the earth shall nothe disturbed‚ and
every inhabitant thereof fall 1ο lamentation, 0111 the final
end as 0 1001 ascend, and 1 will turn your festival days into
wailing, and cast haircloth on the loins 01 every one, 0111 00
the head of every man 1101111000, and make him 00 the 11100111-
ing of one over heloved, 0111 those who 010 with him as 1110
day 01 his sorrow.” And again, α1111110 swerd shall die all
the sinners 01 my peoplc, who say, evils shall not approach,
1101· yet shall light upon us'
