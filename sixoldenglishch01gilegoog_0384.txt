ξ 79. “ Hear therefore the word of our Lord, Ο ye
deceivers, who bear authority over my people that is in
Jerusalem. For ye have said, We have entered into a truce
with death, and with hell we have made a coronant The
overflowing scourge when it shall pass forth shall not fall
upon us, because we hare placed falsehood for our hope, and
by lying we have been defended” And somewhat after:
“And hail shall overthrow the hope of lying‚ together with
the defence. Waters shall overflow, and your truce with
death shall be destroyed, aud your covenant with hell shall
not continue, when the overflowiug scourge shall pass forth3
ye shall also he trodden under foot, whensoever it shall pass
along through you, it shall sweep you away withal.” And
again: “And our Lord hath said: Because this poople
approacheth with their mouth, and with their lips glorify
me, but their heart is far from me3 behold, therefore, lwill
cause this people to wonder by a great and stupendous
miracle. For wisdom shall decay and fell away from her
wisa men, and the understanding of her sagas shall bc oon-

· eealed. Woe be unto you that aro profound in beart, to

conceal counsel from our Lord, whose works are in darkness,
and they say, who scoth usi And who heth known us? for
this thought of yours is perverse.” And afterwards: “Thus
saith our Lord, Heaven is my seat, and the earth my foot-
stool. What is this house that ye will creat anto me, and
what place shall be found for my testing-placei all those
things heth my haud made, and these universally have been
all created, saith our Lord. On whom truly shall I cast
mine eye, but on the humble poor man, and the contrite
in spirit, and him that dreadeth my speechesl he that
sacrificeth an ox, is as he that killeth a man ς he that
slaughtereth a beast for sacrifica, is like him who heateth
out the brains os a dog3 he that offereth an oblaticii, is as
he that offereth the blood of a hog; he thetis mindful oi
frankincense, is as he that honoureth an idol: of all thaso
things have they made choioe in their ways, aud in their
abominatione heth their aoul been delighted?
