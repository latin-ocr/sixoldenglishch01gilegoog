In the year of our Lord's incarnation 855, which was the
reventh after the birth of the aforesaid king, Edmund the
most glorious king of the EastAngles began to reign, on the
eighth dey before the kalende of J anuary‚ i. e. on the birth·
day of our Lord, in the fourteenth year of his age. In
this year olso died Lothaire, the Roman emperor, son of the
pious Lewis Augustus. In the same year the aforesaid
venerable king Ethelwulf released the tenth part of all his
kingdom from all royal service and tribute, and with a peu
never to be forgotten, offered it up to God the One and the
Three in One, in the cross of Christ, for the redemption ol
his own soul and of his predecessore. In the same year he
went to Rome with much honour ; and taking with him his
son, the aforesaid king Alfred, for a second journey thither,
because he loved him more than his other sons, he remained

should never again be received into his kingdom. This crime,
unheard-of in all previous ages, is ascribed by many to the
bishop and earl alone, as resulting from their couusels. Many
also ascribe it solely to the insolence of the king, because
that king was pertinacious in this matter, and in many other

Foras hewas returning from Rome, his son aforesaid, with
all his counsellors‚ or, as I ought to say, his conspirators,
attempted to perpetrate the crime of repulsing the king from
his own kingdom but neither did God permit the deed, nor
would the nobles of all Saxony consent to it. For to prevent
this irremediable evil to Saxony, of a son warring against his
father, or rather of the whole nation carrying on civil war,
