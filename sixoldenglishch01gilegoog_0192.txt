degree of senators. In the meantime Oemvius, duke of the
Wisseans, rebelled against the Roman proconsule, to whom
the government of the island had been committed, aad having
killed them, took possession of the throne. Constantine, upon
information of this, sent Trahern, the uncle of Helena, with
three legions to reduce the island Trahern came to shore
near the city, which in the British tongue is called Kaerperis,
and having assailed it, took it in two days. This news
spreading over the whole country, king Octavius assembled
all the forces of the land, and went to meet him not far from
Winchester, in afield called in the British tongue Maisuriam,
where he engaged with him in battle, and routed him
Trahern, upon this loss, betook himself with his broken
forces to his ships, and in them made a voyage to Albania,
in the provinces of which he made great destruction. When
Octavius received intelligence of this, he followed him with

his forces, and encountered him in Westmoreland, but fied,
having lost the victory. On the other hand, Trahern, when

he found the day was his own, pursned Octavius, nor ever
suffered him to be at rest till he had dispossessed him both
of his cities and crown. Octavius, in great grief for the loss
of his kingdom, went with his fleet to Norway, to obtain
assistance from king Gombert. In the meantime he had
given orders to his most intimate adherente to watch
carefully all opportunities of killing Trahern, which
accordingly was not long after done by the magistrate
of a certain privileged town, who had a more than
ordinary love for him. For as Trahern was one day
upon a journey from London, he lay hid with a hundred
men in the vale of awood, through which he was to pass, ,
and there fell upon him unawares, and killed him in the
midst of his men. This news being brought to Octavius, he
returned back to Britain, where he dispersed the Romans,
and recovered the throne. In a short time after this, he
arrived to such greatness and wealth that he feared nobody,
grad possessed the kingdom until the reign of Gratiae aad
alentinian.
