CHAPTER·

A. 449. When, therefore, nineteen years had elapsed,
Maurice and Valentine† became emperors of Rome; in
whose reign Hengist and Horsa at the invitation of Vorti-
gern king of the Britons arrive at the place called wip-
pid’s·fleet‚ at first on the plea of assisting the Britonsr
but afterwards they rebelled and became their enemies, as
we have already said. Now the number of years, completed
since the marvellous incarnation of our Lord Jesus Christ,
was four hundred and forty·nine.

A. 455. In the sixth year after, Hengist and Horsa
fought a battle against Vortigern in the plain of AEgels·
threp. There Horsa was killed, and Hengist obtained the
kin dom.

ἓ. 457. But after two years, Hengist and AEsc his sou
renewed the war against the Britons 3 and there fell in that
day on the side of the Britons four thousand men 'rhen
the Britons, leaving Cantia, which is commonly called Kent,
fied to the city of London.

A. 465. About eight years aiter, the same men took up
arms against the Britons, and there was a great slaughter
made on that day: twelve chiefs of the Britons fell near a
place called Wipped's·fleat; there fell a soldier of the Saxone

called Wipped, from which circumstance that place took its
