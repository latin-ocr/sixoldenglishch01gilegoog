hut Ihave got together all that I could find as well from the
anneis of the Romans as from the chronicles of the sacred
fathers, Hieronymus, Eusebius, Isidorus, Prosper, and from
the annuis of the Scots and Saxona, and from our ancient
traditions. Many teachers end scribes hare attempted ιο
write this, hut somehow or other have abandoned it from ita
difficulty, citheron account of frequent deaths, or the often
recurring calamities of war. Ipray that every reader who
shall read this book, may pardon me, for having attempted,
like a chattering jay, or like some weak witness, to write
these things, after they had failed. Iyield to himwho knows
more of these things than I do.
