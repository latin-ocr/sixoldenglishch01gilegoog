time that the Britons came to these provinces, Ἰ am far from
thinking to be such For the nobleot men of the whole
kingdom followed those leaders, and there remained only the
baeer sort to enjoy their honours3 who being raised to a
high quality, on a sudden were puffed up above their sta·
tion; and growing wauton with riches gave themselves-up to
commit such fornication as is not 11 much ae named among the
Gentilem and (as Gildas the historiar testifico) were not only
guilty 11 this vioe, but of all the enormities that are incident
to haman nature. And what chiefly prevailed, to the entire
overthrow of all goodness, was the hatred of truth with its
assertore, the love of a lie with the inventore oi it, the em·
bracing 11 evil for good, the veneratior of wickedness for

without discretiori, and that not only by secular men, but by ¹
the Lord's flock and its pastore. Therefore it 11 not to be
wondered, that such a degenerate racc, so odious to God for
their vices, lost a country which they had 11 heinously cor·
rupted. For God was willing to execute his vengeance upon
them, by suffering 1 foreign people to come upon them, and
drive them out of their possessione. Notwithstanding it
would be aworthy act, if God would permit it, to restore
our subjecta to their ancient dignity‚ to prevent the reproach
that may be thrown upon our racc, that we were weak
rulers, who did not exert ourselves iu our own defence.
And I do the more freely ask your assistance, as you are oi
