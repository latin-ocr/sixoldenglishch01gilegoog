S 106. But why in using these testimonias, here and
there dispersed, are we any longer, as it were, tossed up and
down in the silly boat of our simple understanding, on the
Α waves of sundry interpretatione? We have now therefore
at length thought it necessary to have recourse to those
lessons* which are gathered out of Holy Scripturea to the
end that they should not only be rehearsed, hut also be
aasenting and assisting unto the henediction, wherewith the
hands of priests, and others of inferior sacred orders, are
first consecrated, and that thereby they may continually he

Lord Jesus Christ from the dead, into an inheritance which
can never corrupt, never wither, neither be defiled, preserved
in heaven for you, who a're kept in the virtue of God ;” why
thcn do ye fondly violate such an inheritance, which is not
as an earthly one, transitory, but immortal and eternal?
And somewhat afterwards: “For which cause be ye girded
in the loins of your mind, sober, perfectly hoping in that
grace which is offered tc you in the revelation of Jesus
Christ:” examine ye now the depths of your hearts‚
whether ye he sober and do perfectly preserve the grace of
priesthood, which shall he dely discussed and decided in the
revelation of our Lord And again he saith: “As children
of the henediction, not configuring yourselves to those
former desires of your ignorance; but according unto him
who hath called you holy, be ye also holy in all conversation.
