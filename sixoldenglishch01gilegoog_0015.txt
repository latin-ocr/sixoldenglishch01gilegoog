Os Gilda, tne supposed author of the third work con·
tained in this volume, little or nothing is known. ΜΓ. Ste-
vens0n‚ in the preface to his edition of the original Latin,
lutely published by the English Historical Society, says:

“We are unable to speak with certainty as to his parentage,
his country, or even his name, the period when he lived, or
the works οἰ which he was the author? Such a statement
is surely sufficient to excuse us at present from saying more

the old translation is as follows: “ Τὶιθ Epistle of Gildas the
most ancient British Author z who flourished in the yeere
of our Lord, 546. And who by his great erudition, sanc· ¹
titis, and wisdome, acquired the name of Sapinia. Faithl'ully

ema IV.-NENNIUS.

uun History of the Britons, which occupies the fourth
place in this volume is generally ascribed to Nennius‚ but
so little is known about the author, that we have hardly any
information handed down to us respecting him except this
mention of his name. It is also far from certain at what
period the history was written, and the difference is no less
than a period of two hundred years, some assigning the
