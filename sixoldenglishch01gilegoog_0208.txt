ermom.

Consrans, being thus advanoed, committed thc whole
government of the kingdom to Vortigem‚ and surrendered
himself up so entirely to his counsels, that he did nothing
without his order. His own incapacity for government
obliged him to do this, for he hed learned any thing else
rather thun state affairs within his cloistar. Vortigern
became sensible of this, and therefore began to deliberato
with himself what course to take to obtain the crown, oi
which he had been before extremely ambitione. He saw
that now was his proper time to gain his end easily, whn
the kingdom was wholly intrusted to his management3 and
Constans, who bore the title of king, was no more than the
shedow of one; for he was of asoft temper, abad judge in
matters of right, and notin the least feared, either by his
own people‚ or by the neighbouring states. And as for his
two brothers, Uther Pendragon and Aurelius Ambrosius,
they were only children in their cradles, and therefore
incapable of the government. There was likewisc this
further misfortune, that all the older persons of the nobility
were dead, so that Vortigern seemed to be the only man
surviving, that had craft, policy, and experiencc in matters
of state ; and all the rest in a manner children, or raw
youths, who only inherited the honours of their parents and
relations that had been killed in the former wars. Vortigern,
finding a concurrente of so many favourable circumstances,
contrived how he might easily and cunniugly depose Constans
the monk, and immediately establish himself in his place.
But in order to do this, he waited until he had first well
established his power and interest in several countries. Hc
therefore petitioned to have the king’s treasures, and hia
fortified cities, in his own custody; pretending there was a
rumour, that the neighbouring islanders designed an invasion
of the kingdom. This being granted him, he placed his own
creaturos iu those citios, to secure them for himself. rhen

having immed a scheme how to execute his treasonable

designa, he went to the king, and represented to him the
necessity of¹augmenting the number of his domestice. thot
