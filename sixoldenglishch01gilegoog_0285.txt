he drew off from the rest a large party of those whom he
knew to be the stoutest men, and spoke to them after this
manner: “Since wc have begun this fignt without Arthur's
knowledge, we must take care that we be not defeated in
the cnterprise Tor, if we should, we shall both very much
endanger our men, and incur the king’s high displeasure.
Rouse up your oourage, and follow me through the Roman
squadrons, that with the favour of good fortune we may
either kill or take Petreius prisoner.” With this they put
spurs to their horses, and piercing through the enemres'
thickest ranks, reached the place where Petreius was giving
his commanda. Boso hastily ran in upon him, and grasping

him about the neck, fell with him to the ground, as he had .

intended. The Romans hereupon ran to his delivery, as did

with the other prisoners before Arthur, with great joy for
the victory. Arthur congratulated them upon it, and pro·
mised them advancement to greater honours, for behaving
themselves so gallantly'when he was absent from thern.
Then he gave his command to some of his men, to conduct
the prisoners the next day to Paris, and deliver them to be
kept in oustody there till further orders. The party that
were to undertake this charge, he ordered to be conducted
by Cadur, Bedver, and the two consuls, Batauus aud Rich·
