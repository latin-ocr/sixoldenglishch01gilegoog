111. THE EPISTLE-

27. Butram has kings, but they are tyrants; she has
ju es, but unrighteous ones3 generally engaged in plunder
and rapine, but always preylng on the innocent3 whenever
they exert themselves to avenge or protect, it is sure to be
ιιι favour of robbers and criminals; they have an abundanoe
of wives, yet are they addicted to ’fornication and adultery3
they are ever ready to take oaths‚ and as oftenpe perjure
themselves, they make a vow and almost immediately act
salsely‚ they make war, but their wars are against their
countrymen‚ and are unjust ones3 they rigorously· prosecute
thieves throughout their country, but those who sit at table
with them are robbers, and they not only cherish but reward
them; they give alms plentifully, but in eontrast to this is a
whole pile of crimes which they have committed, they sit
cn the seat of justice, but rarely seek for the rule of nght
judgment; they despise the innocent and the humble,rlg but
ltttittttltttltllttlhhhtltltlltt
enemies of God, who ought to be utterly destroyed and their
names forgotten.

They have many prisoners in their gaols, loaded with
chains, but this is' done in treachery rather than in just
punishment for crimes3 and when they have stood before
the altar, swearing by the name oi God, they go away and
think no more of the holy altar than if it were a mere heap
of dirty stenes.
