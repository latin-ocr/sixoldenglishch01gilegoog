‚broke the compact which they had before solemnly made with
the Western Angles, and they take up their winterouarters
at Chippenham. The people were everywhere unable to

Somerset lived with a narrow retinue in a certain wood, and

seems to have been situated in a marsh. But the aforesaid
king fought daily battles against the barbariam, having with
him the province of Somerset only 3 no others assisted him,
except the servants who made use of the king’s pasturas. In ’
the same year arrived Halfdene brother of the tyrant
Hingwar with thirty galleys, in the western parts crithe
Angles, and besieged Odda duke of Devon in a certain
castle, and war was stirred up on all sides. The king of the
barbarians fell, and eighty decads with him. At last the

honora.
