And choirs 01 virgins celebrate thy praise?

four turns round the altar, poured the wine into the tire, and
then laid himself down upon the hart’s skin, which 110 had
spread before the altar, where he fell asleep. About the
third hour of the night, the usual time for deep sleep, the
goddess seemed to present herself before him, and foretell
his future success as follows :-

“ Brute i sub occasum solis trans Gallica regna

Insula in oceano est undique clausa mari z

Insula in oceano est habitata gigantibus olim,
Nunc deserta quidem, gentibus apta tuis, ·

Hanc pete, nemque tibi sedes erit illa perennis:
Sic fiet natis altera ijs hiis

sie de prole tus reges nascamur: et ipsis
roem terra subditus orbis erit.'’

An island which the western sea sirmundo,

mere fate dscrees 10 raiae a second Troy,

And found an empirc in thy royal line,

Whi»,¹ ''ane shall ne’er destroy, nor boanda confine.

Awahened by the vision, he was for some time in doubt
with himself, whether what he had seen was 0 dream or a
real appearance of the goddess herself, foretelling to what
laud he should go. At last he called to his companions, and
related to them in order the vision he had in his sleep, at
which they ver'y much rejoiced, and were urgent to return
to their ships, and while the wind favoured them, to hasten
their voyage towards the west, in pursuit of what the god-
