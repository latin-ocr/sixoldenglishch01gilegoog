the endeavours of your evil actions you traad under footr
neither yet have ye the simplicity of doves, but the
resemblance rather of the black crow, which taking her
llight out⁴ of the ark, thetis, the church of God, and finding
the carrion of earthly pleminas, did never with epure

“ Fear not,” saith he, “ them who kill the body, but are not
able to slay the soul; but fear him who can overthrow both
soul and body in hell.’' Revolve in your minds which of
