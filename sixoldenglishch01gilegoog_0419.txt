’ ς 17. I have learned another account of this Brutus from

the ancient books of our ancestors! After the deluge, the
, three sons of Noah severally occupied three different parts
of the earth: Shem extended his borders into Asia, Ham
into Africa, and J apheth into Europe.

The first man that dwelt in Europe was Alanus, with his
three sons, Hisicion, Armenon‚ and Neugio. Hisicion had
four sons, Francus, Romanus, Alemonam, and Brutus.
Armenon had five sons, Gothus, Valagothus‚ Cibidus
Burgundus, and Longobardus. Neugio had three sons,
Vandalus, Saxo, and Boganus. From Hisicion arose four
nations-the Franks, the Latins, the Germans, and Britons:
from Amenon, the Gothi, Valagothi, Cibidi, Burgundi, and
Longobardi: from Neugio, the Bogan', Vandali, Saxones,
and Tarincgi. The whole of Europe was subdivided into
thesetribes.

Alanus is said to have been the son of Fethuir ;† Fethuir

this information respecting the original inhabitants of Britain
from ancient tradition.

S 18. The Britons were thus called from Brutus: Brutus

Alanus was the sonos Rhea Silvia, Rhea Silvia was the
daughter of Numa Pompilius, Numa was the son oi
Ascanius, Ascanius of Eneas‚ Encas of Anchises, Anchises

reland, and they make 438 years. And from the arrival of St. Patrick
to the cyclo of 19 years in which ve live are 22 cycles, which make 421
ears
y ⁴ This proves the tradition of Brutus to be older than Geoffrey or
Tyssilio, unless these notices of Brutus have been interpolated in the origi·
