Isaiah, “ Woo be to them who 'eall good evil, and evil good,
placing darkness for light, and light for darkness, bitter for
sweet, and sweet for bitter, who seeing see not, and hearing
hear not, whose hearts are overshadowed with a thick and
black'oloud of vices ;'’ Iwill briefly set down the threaten-

vicus horses, the frantie followers 01 Pharaoh, through whom
