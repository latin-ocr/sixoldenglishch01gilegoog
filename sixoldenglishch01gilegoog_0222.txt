me to seek out a man that had no father, with whose blood

at his words, and presently ordered the magicians to come,
and sit down before Merlin, who spohe to them after this
manner: “Because you are ignorant what it is that hinders
the foundation of the tower, you have recommended the
shedding of my blood for oement to it, as if that would pre·
sently make it stand. But tell me now, what is there under
the foundation? For something there is that will not suffer
it to stand.” The magicians at this began to be afraid, aud
made him no answer. Then said Merlin, who was ulso called
Ambrose, “I entreat your majesty would command your
worhmen to dig into the ground, and you will find a pond
which causes the foundation to sink.” This accordingly was
dono, and then presently they found a pond deep under
ground, which had made it give way. Merlin afterthis went
again to the magicians, and said, “Tell me ye false syco-
phants, what is there under the pond.’' But they were
silent. Then said he again to the king, “ Command the pond
to be drained, and at the bottom you will see two hollow
stones, and in them two dragous asleep.” The king made
no scruple of believing him, since he had found true what
he said of the pond, and therefore ordered it to be drained:
which done, he found as Merlin had said 3 and now was
possessed with the greatest admiration of him. Nor were
' the rest that were present less amazed at his wisdom, think-
ing it to be no less than divine inspiration.
