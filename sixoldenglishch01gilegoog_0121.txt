words :-

“ Brutus, general of the remainder of the Trojans, to
Pandrasus, king of the Greeks, sends greeting. As it was
beneath the dignity of a nation descended from the illus·
tricus racc of Dardanus to be treated in your kingdom
otherwise than the nobility of their birth required, they
have betaken themselves to the protection of the woods.

thickest of the woods, to which they have retired to avoid
slavery. But if you deny them this favour, then by your
permissign and assistance let them depart into some foreign
country.

Sparatinum‚ Brutus made a sally with three thousand meu,
and fell upon him unawares. For having intelligeuce of his
coming, he had got into the town the night before, with a
design to break forth upon them unexpectedly, while nn·

great slaughter. The Greeks, astonished‚ immediately give

way on all sides, and with the king at their head, hasten to ¹
