Cusr. XVII.-Drmwollo Molmutine paim the sceptro os Britain, from
whom come the Molmutine lewa

Ar length arose a youth of great spirit, named Dunwallo
Molmutine, who was the son of Cloten king ot' Cornwnll·
and excelled all the kings of Britain in valour and gracefnl·
ness of person. When his father was dead, he was ιιο ⁶
sooner possessed of the government os that country, than he
made war against Ymner king of Loegria, and killed him in
battle. Hereupon Rudaucus king of Kambria, and statarius
king of Albania, had a meeting‚ wherein they formed an
alliance together, and marched thence with their armies into
Dunwallo's country to destroy all before them. Dunwallo
met them with thirty thousand men, and gave them battle3
and when a great part of the day was spent in the fight, and
- the victory yet dubious, he drew off six hundred of his

the enemies that were slain, as he himself also did, throwing

to the enemy's ranks, as if he was of their party, and ap·

were, commanded his men to fall upon them. In this Α

them. But Dunwallo Molmutius, fearing lest in this disguise
his own men might fall upon him, returned with his com·
panions to put off the enemy’s armour, and take his own

which they did with great vigour, and in a short time got
the victory, by dispersing and putting to flight the enemy.
From hence he marched into the enemjs countries, destroyed
their towns and cities, and reduced the peoplc under his
obedience. When he had made an entire reductiones the
whole island, he prepared sor himself a crown of gold, and
restored the kingdom to its ancient state. This prince
established what the Britons call the Molmutine laws, which·
are famous among the English to this day. In these, among
other things, of which St. Gildas wrote a long time after, bc
