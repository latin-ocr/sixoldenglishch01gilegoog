Isthmus may be termed Caledonia, yet the proper Caledoniam
dwelt beyond the varan, from which c linc drawn accurately
points out the boundary of the Roman empire in Britain.
The hithermost part of the island was ct different times iu
their possession, and the remainder‚ as we have related, wcs
occupied by barbarous Britons. The ancient documento ol
history ufford some information thus far; but beyond the
Varar the light is extinct, and we ere enveloped in darkness.³
Althongh we know that the Romans erected alters there to
mark the limits of their empire, and thot Ulysses, tossed by a
violent tempest, here fullilled his vows; yet the thick woods
and a continued chain of rugged mountains forbid all further
research We must therefore be satisfied with the following
informatiom gleaned from the wandering merchants of tho
Britons, which we leave for the use of posterity.

52. The Caledonians⁴ properly so called, inhabiled the
country to the westward of the Varar, and part of their
territory was covered by the extensive forest called the Cule-
doniun wood.

53. Less considerable pecple dwelt near the coast Of
these the Cantre⁵ were situated beyond the Varar, cnd the
above-mentioned altars, to the river Loxa,⁶ and in their
territory was the promontory Penoxullum.⁷

dl N ext in order is the river Abona,8 and the inhabitants
nearit, the Iegis Then the river Ila,l near which lived
the Carnnbii² the most remote of the Britons These

poople being subdued by the propraetor Ostorius, and
impatiently bearing the Roman yoke, joined the cante. ts

⁸ It must be confessed that the informaticn preserved by Richard iu
segurd to this remote part of our island, is extremely obscure, and that his
descriptions will only assist us in gnessing at the situation of the different
tribes. Perhaps this ccn scarcely be deemed extraordinavy, when ve con·
nider how imperfectly the interior of this country is known even at present

‘The country of the proper Caledonians was tha centrsl part of
Inverness and Ross.
