tariness unto Israel, or a lete bearing landi why therefore
hath my people said, we have departed, we will come no
more unto thee? Doth the virgin forget her ornament, or
the spouse her gorgeti my people truly hath forgotten me
for innumerable days. Because my people are foolish‚ they
have not known me, they are unwise and mad children.
They are wisc to do evil, but to do well they have been
i norant.’'

g § 48. Thon the prophet speaketh in his own person saying,
“O Lord thine eyes do respect faith, thou hest strichen them,
and they have not sorrowed, thou hest broken them and they
have refused to receive discipline, they have made their
faces harder than the roob, and will not return.” And also
our Lord: “Declare ye this same to the house of Jacob,
and make it to be heard in Judah, saying‚ Hem, ye foolish
people who have no beart, who having eyes see not, and ears
hear not. Will ye not therefore dread me, saith our Iord.
and will ye not conceive grief from my countenance, who
have placed the sand as the bound of the sea, an eternal
commandment which she shall not break, and her waves
shall be moved, and they cannot, and her surge shall swelI,
and yet not pass the same? But to this people is framed an
incredulous and an exasperating heart, they have retired
and gone their ways, and not in their beart said, Iret us fear
our Lord God.'’ And again, “Because there are found
among my people wicked ones, framing wiles to entangle as
if they were fowlers, setting suares and gins to catch men z
as a net that is full of birds, so are their houses filled with
deceits. Therefore are they magnified and enriched‚ they
are become gross and fat, and have neglected my speeches
most vilely‚ the orphans’ cause they have not decided, and
the justice of the poor they have not adjudged. What!
shall Ι not visit these men, saith our Lord? or shall not my
soul be revenged upon such a nation ?”

ξ 49. But God forbid that ever should happen unto you,
that which followeth, “Thou shalt spsak all these words
unto them, and they shall not hear thee 3 and thou shalt call
them, and they shall not answer thee; ·and thou shalt say un·
to them, This rs tle nation that heth not heard the voice of
their Lord (iod, nor yet received discipline, faith hath
perished, aud been taken away from out of their mouth·
