eulted with his brother Horsa and the other ancient men
present, what to do in relation to the king's request. They
unanimously advised him to give him his daughter, and in oon·
sideration of her to demand the province of Kent. Accord-
ingly the daughter was without delay delivered to Vortigern,
and the province of Kent to Hengist, without the knowledge

slight my advice, since it is to my countrymen you must owe
the conquest of all your enemies. Let us invite over my
eon Octa and his brother Ebissa, who are breve soldiers, and '

Britain, by the wall, between Deira end Albania. For they
