and hence it was anciently a proverbial expression, in refer·
enee to its kings and rulers, “He reigned over Britain and
its three islands.’'

all directions, to the east and west, to the south and north3
but there are two pre-eminently distinguished among the
rest, the Thames and the Severn, which formerly, like the
two arms of Britain, bore the ships employed in the convey·
ance of the riches acquired by commerce. The Britons were
once very populous, and exercised extensive dominion from
sea to sea.

§ 10stl Respecting the period when this island became in·
habited subsequently to the flood, I have seen two distinct
relations. According to the annals of the Roman history,
the Britons deduce their origin both from the Greeks and
Romans. On the side of the mother, from Lavinia, the
daughter of Latinus, king of Italy, and of the rece of Silva·
nus, the son of Inachus, the son of Dardanns3 who was the
son of Satura, king of the Greeks, and who, having pos·
sessed himself of a part of Asia, built the city of Troy.
Dardanus was the father of Troius, who was the father of
Priam and Anchises; Anchises was the father of AEneas,
who was the father of Ascanius and Silvius; and this Sil·
vius was theson of AEneas and Lavinia, the daughter of the
king of Italy. From the sons of AEneas and Lavinia de·
scended Romulus and Remus, who were the sons of the holy
queen Rhea, and the -founders of Rome. Brutus was consul
when he conquered Spain, and reduced that country to a
Roman province. He afterwards subdned the island of
Α Britain, whose inhabitants were the descendants of the
Romans, from Silvius Posthumus. Hc was called Posthu-
mus because he was born efter the death of AEneas his father;
and his mother Lavinia concealed herself during her preg-
nancy3 hc was called Silvius, because he was born in awood.
Hence the Roman kings were called Silvan, and the Britons
who sprang from him; but they were called Britons from
Brutus, and rose from the family of Brutus.

AEneas, aiter the Trojan war, arrived with his son in Italy;
and having vanquished Turnus, married Lavinia, the daugh-
