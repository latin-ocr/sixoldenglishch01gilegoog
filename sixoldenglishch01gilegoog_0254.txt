Iu the meantime, assoon aa the king's absence was discovered
at the siege, his army unadvisedly made an asaault upon the
walls, and provoked the besieged count to a battlo; who
himself also, acting as inconsiderately as they, sallied forth

with his men, thinking with such a small handful to oppone
a powcrful armyz but happened to be killed in the very first
brunt of the light, and had all hiemen routed. The town
also was taken; but all the riches 01 it were not shared
equally among the besiegers, but every one greedily took
what he could get, according as fortune or his own strength
favoured him. After this bold attempt, came messengers to
Igcrna, with the newa both of the dukc's death, and 01 the
event of the siege. But when they saw the king in the
likeness 01 the consul, sitting 01010 by her, they were struck
with shame and astonishment at his safe arrival there, whom
they had left dead at the sicge; for they wcre wholly
ignorant 01 the miracles which Merlin had wrought with his
medicines. The king therefore smiled at the news, and em·
bracing the countess, said to her: “Your own eyes may
convince you that I am not dead, but alive. But notwith-
standing, thc destruction 01 the town, and the slaughter of
my men, is what very much grieves me3 so that there is
reason to fear the king's coming upon us, and taking usin
this place. To prevent which, I will go out to meet him,
arrd make my peace withhim, for fcar of aworse disaster?
Accordingly, assoon aa hc was out 01 the town he went to
his army, and having put off the disguise of Gorlois‚ was
now Uther Pendragon again. When he had a full relation
made to him how matters had succecded, he was sorry 101
the death 01 Gorlois‚ but rejoiced that Igerna was now at
liberty to marry again. Then hc returned to the town of
Tintagcl, which he took, and' 1n it, what he impatiently
wished for, Igerna hcrsclf. After this they cont tinued to
live together with much affection 101 each other, and had a
son and daughter, whose names were Arthur and Anne.
