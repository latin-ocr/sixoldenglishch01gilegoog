to war, retained the provinca by gentleness. Thi barbarossa
Britons ceasing to be ignorant ol· luxury, and the termination
of civil wars, gave him an excuse for inactivity. But dis·
cord called forth his exertions; for the soldiery, when re·
leased from military labours‚ grew wauton from too mnch
rest. Trebellius, having evaded the rege of the army by
ssight, was shortly allowed to resume the command, the licen·
tiousness ol' the soldiery becoming as it were a composition
for the safetyof the general. This sedition ended without
bloodshed.

11. Nor did Vectius Bolanus, although the civil wars still
continued, harass Britain by restoring discipline. There
was the same inactivity towards the enemy, and the same iu·
subordination in the garrisons3 but Bolanus, being agood
man and not disliked, acquired affection instead of authority.

12. But when, with the rest of the world, Vespasian had
recovered Britain, we see distinguished generals, famous
armies, and the enemy dispirited: Petilius Cerealis imme·
diately excited terror by attacking the state of the Brigantes,
which was esteemed the most populous of the province.
Many battles were fought, some of which were bloody, and
a great part of the Brigantian territory was either eon·
quered or invaded.

13. But although Cerealis had diminished the care and
fame of his successor, the burden was sustaiued by Julius
Frontinus, aman of high courage. Overcomiug at once the
spirit of the enemy and the difficulties of the country, he
subjugated the warlike and powerful nation of the Silures.

14. To him succeeded Agricola, who not only maintained
the peace of the province3 but for seven years carried on
war against the Caledonians and their warlike king Galga·
cus. He thus added to the Romanvempire nations hitherto
unknown.

15. But Domitian, envying the superior glory of Agricola
recalled him, and sent his lientenant Lucullus into Britain,
because he had suffered lances of a new sorm to be named
Luculleas after him.

16. His successor was Trebellius, under whom the two
provinces, namely, Vespasiana and Maeata, were meted
from the Roman government; for the Romans gave thom·
solves up to luxury.
