Similsr marks of difference between the original British trackways and
the Roman roads appear in the Foss, and the Iknield Street 5-the latter,
during the greater part of its course, keeping along the chain of hills which
lay in its way, not leading decidedly to Roman towns, throwing out paraliae¹
branches, attended always with tumuli, still bearing its British name, and
‘whichfinitima?tullli⁰tt¹lnltlt¹llltn
the Romans themselves, are distinguished by peculiar marks. Poeta or
towns are placed on them at nearly regular distanoes, seldom exoeeding
twenty miles, the length of asingIe march, and also at the point where two
roeds inter-sect each other, or where several reads diverge. ‘l'hese roads
are elevated with surprising labour to the height of ten feet, and sometimes
eren more, instances of which may be seen on the heath near Woodyates
Inn ih Dorsetshire, near Old Sarum on the side of Ford, in Chnte
Psrlr, wilte, between Ancaster and Lincoln, and still more remarkably on
Brsmham Moor, near 'l'adcaster in Yorkshire. 'l'hey were formed of nnete·
rials often brought from a considerable distance, such es elrallr, pebbles, or
gravei ς and the most considerable are pared with stones, which are visible
tothis da'y. Tumuli also, which seem to have been the directionposts of
antiquity, attended their course, and occur in almost every instance where
aroad descendas hill, approaches a station, or throne offs branch.
Another peculiarityof the Roman waysis their straight direction, from
which they seldom deviato, except to avoid a rapid escant ordesoent, to
throw oii' another rond, or to approach a station, which, from the circurn-
stanoes before mentioned, had been fixed out of the general line. 0f this
there lse curious instance where the Foss, in approaching cirencester from
the north, meets the hiemen street, bearing to the same point from the
north-eagt, aad evidently bends out of its course to join and enter the sta·
tion wit it.

Of msny of the Roman roads, not only in England, but in the greater
part of the Roman empire, an soconnt has been preserved under the name
of the Itinerary of Antoninus, which specifies the towns or stations on
esch road,and shows the distnnoes between them. 'l'his record was long
supposed to be a public directory or goide for the march of soldiers3 but
if this were the case, itisextremely confused and imperfect. It often omits
in one Iter or journey towns which are directly in its course, and yet speci·
fies mem in another, as may be seen in the first, second, sixth, and eighth
Iters. lt traces the same rond more than once, and penses nnnoticed sorne
of the most remarkable roads in the island, namely a great part of the
Foss, and the whole of the Via Deoono (a rond from Colchester to Ches-
ter.) Hence this Itinerary has been more Justly considered as the heads oi a

with grem appearance oi probability, in th’e suite of the emperor Adrion.
ln this light it may be considered ns copious, and the advantages which it
has afforded to the antiquary will be gratefully and universally achnow-
lodged. still, however, from the incoherence which appears in that pert
relatingto our island, aad from the mutilated copies which have been
found, there is reason to imnyp'ne that the whole of this interesting record

hv nrt escsped the ravages of time.
