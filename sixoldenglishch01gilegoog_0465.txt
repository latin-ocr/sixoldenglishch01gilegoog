and that built by the emperor Antoninus Pius, from the
estuary of the Bdora⁹ to that of the Clydda¹ Vespasiano
stretches from the estuary of the Bdora to the city of Al·
cluith,² from whence a line drawn to the mouth of the Varar³
shows the boundery. Britannia Sanno faces the Irish Sea
to the north and west. But sufficient notice has now been
taken of the provinces.

3. Before we proceed to a more minute description, let us
touch upon the form of government In remote times all
Britain was divided among petty princes and states, some of
whom are said to have existed after the country was occupied
by the Romans3 though, under the Roman domination, they
retained scarcely the shadow of regal authority. A legate
being appointed by the emperor over the conquered countries,
Britain became a proconsular province. This form of go-
vernment continued several ages, although in the meantime
the island uuderwent many divisions, first into the Upper
and Lower districts, and then, as we have before shown, into
seven parts. It afterwards became the imperial residenoe of
Carausius and those whom he admitted to a share of his
power. Constantine the Great, the glory and defence of
Christianity, is supposed to have raised Maxima and Valen-
tia to consular provinces, and Prima, Secunda, and Flavia, to
praesidiale. But over the whole island was appointed a
deputygovernor, under the authority of the praetorian pre·
fect of Gaul. Besides whom, an ancient volume, written
about that period, mentions a person of great dignity, by
the title of eomes, or count of the Britons, another as count
of the Saron coast, and a third as leader or duke of Britain;
with many others, who, although possessed of great offioes,
must be passed over in silence, for want of certain inform·
ation.⁴

4. I now commenoe my long Journey, to examine minutely
the whole island and its particular parts, and shall follow the
footsteps of the best authors. 1 begin with the extreme part
of the first province, whose coasts are opposite Gaul This
province contains three celebrated and powerful states,
