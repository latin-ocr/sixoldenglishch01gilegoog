Such appears to bc the incorrectness of the numerals attached to this
Iter, ss well ss to the corresponding Iter os Antonine, that, although four
of the six staticus are well known, and a fisth can scarcely be mistalren‚
yet, we can in no other wey obviate the difficulty than by supposing a station
omitted, or by nlterlng the numerals, none of which, except the first, agree
with the distantes between the vestiges cI the different stations and their
supposed sites 3 for example, ln the first part between York and Manches·
ter, where the Itinerary gires only 49 miles, the nearest rond through
Heathersfield amounts to 65.

As the only great and undoubted Roman statmn between Tadcaster and
Manchesteris at Slack (for the cumps et Kirklees, and Castleshaw, are
only temporary poste), it will perhaps be justifiablc to fix this point as the
site cf Cambodunum to suppose ten miles omitted in tbis magu andin
tbe next to conjecture that, by a common error in copying the Roman
numerals, XVIII. bas been substituted for XXIII. the exact distnnoe from
Slnclr to Manchester.

As the Mersey was undoubtedly the bonndary on the West between the
Roman provinces of Maxima and Flavia, and as the Romnn rond still
existing crossed it at Stretfcrd, we fix the next point thess, and change the
number XVII. to VI. 'Ihc two next stations oi Omtdate and Deva, ths
numerals iffi 6 slight alteratIon) permit us tc fix at Xinderton and
Chester. t ir worthy cI remark, that with these ulteraticns the sum total
of the numerals rernaIns nearly the same.
