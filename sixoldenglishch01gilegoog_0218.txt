gist, hearing that Vortimer was dead, raised an army of no
less than three hundred thousand mon, and fitting out a ficet
returned with them to Britain. When Vortigern and the
nobility heard of the arrival of so vast a multitude, they were
immoderately incensed, and, after consultation together, re·
solved ιο fight them, and drive them from their coasts.
Hengist, being informed of their design by messengefs sent
from his daughter, immediately entered into 'deliberation
what course to pursue against them. After several strata·
geme had been considered, he judged it most feasible, to im·
pose upon the nation by making show of peace. With this
view he sent ambassadors to the king, to declare to him, that
he had not brought so great a number of men for the pur·
pose either of staying with him, or offering any violence to
the country. But the reason why he brought them, was
&cause he thought Vortimer was yet living, and that he
should have occasion sor them against him, in ease of an
assault. But now since he no longer doubted of his being
dead, he submitted himself and his people to the disposal of
Vortigern3 so that he might retain as many of them as he
should think fit, and whomsoever he rejected Hengist would
allow to return back without delay to Germany. And if
these terma pleased Vortigern, he desired him to appoint a
time and place for their meeting, and adjusting matters
according to his pleaaura When these things were repre·
sented to the king, he was mightily pleased, as being very
unwilling ιο part with Hengist ; and at last ordered his sub·
jects and the Saxons to meet upon the kalende of May, which
were now very near, at the monastery of Ambrius,* for the
settling of the matters above mentioned. The appointment
being agreed to on both sides, Hengist, with a new design oi Α
villany in his head, ordered his soldiers to carry every one
of them a long dagger under their garments; and while the
conference should be held with the Britcns, who would have
no suspicion of them, he would give them this word of com-
mand, “ Nemet oure Saxas ;” at which moment they were all
to be ready to seire boldly every one his next man, and with
his drawn dagger stab him. Accordingly they all met at the

time and place appointed, and began to treat oi peaee3 md
when a fit opportunity offered for executing his villany,
