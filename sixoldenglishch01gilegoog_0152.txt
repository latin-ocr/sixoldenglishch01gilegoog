carried them to Belinus, who was upon the sea-coast,
expeeting the arrival of his brother. There were with
Guichthlac’s ship three others, one of which had belonged
to Brennius's fleet. As soon as they had declared to the
king who they were, he was overyoyed at this happy

accident, while he was endeavouring to revenge himself
on his brother.

A rrvv days after appeared Brennius, with his fleet again
got together, and arrived in Albania3 and having received
information of the capture of his wife and others, and that
his brother had seized the kingdom of Nerthumberland in
his absence, he sent his ambassadors to him, to demand the
restitution of his wife and kingdom 3 and if he refused them,
to declare that he would destroy the whole island from sea to
sea, and kill his brother whenever he could come to an
engagement with him. On the other hand, Belinus absolutely
refused to comply with his demands, and assembling together
the whole power of the island, went into Albania to give him
battle. Brennius, upon advice that he had suffered a repulse,
and that his brother was upon his march against him,
advanced to meet him in a wood called Calaterium, in order
to attack him. When they were arrived on the field of
battle, each of them divided his men into several bodies, and
approaching one another, began the light A great part
of the day was spent in it, because on both sides the brevest
men were engaged3 and much blood was shed by reason
of the fury with which they encountered each other. Se
great was the slaughter, that the wounded fell in heaps, like
standing corn out down by reapers. At last the Britons
prevailing, the Norwegians lled with their shattered troops
to their ships, but were pursucd by Belinus, and killed
without mercy. Fifteen thousand men fell in the battle, nor
were there a thousand of the rest that escaped unhurt.
Brennius with much difficulty securing one ship, went as
fortune drove him to the coasts of Gaul; but the rest that
attended him, were forced to sculk up and ‹ltwn wherever
their misfortunes led them.
