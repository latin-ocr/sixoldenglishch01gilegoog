to have for their king nster his deceose Por be bad no son,
and only one daughter, to whom he could leave the crown.
Some, therefore, advised him to bestow his daughter with
the kingdom upon some noble Roman, to the end that they

might enjoy a firmer peace. Others were of opinion that '

Conan Meriadoc, his nephew‚ ought to be preferred to the
throne, and the daughter married to some prince of another
kingdom with a dowry in money. While these things were
in agitation among them, there came Caradoc, duke of ,
Oornwall, and gave his advice to invite over Maximian ⁸ the ⁴¹
senator, and to bestow the lady with the kingdom upon him,
which would be a means of securing to them a lasting peace.
For bis father Leolin, the uncle of Constantine, whom we
mentioned before, was a Britan, but· by his mother and place
of birth he was a Roman, and by both parents he was
descended of royal blood. And there was a sure prospect
of a firm and secure peace under him, on account of the right
which he had to Britain by his descent from the emperors,
and also from the British blood. But the duke of Cornwall,
by delivering this advice, brought upon himself the dis·
pleasure of Conan, the king’s nephew‚ who was very
ambitious of sueceeding to the kingdom, and put the
whole court into confusion about it. However‚ caradoc,
being unwilling to recede from his proposal, sent his son
Mauricius to Rome to acquaint Maximian with what had
passed. Mauricius was a person of large and well-propon-
tioned stature, as well as great courage and boldness, and
could not bear to have his judgment contradieted without a
recourse to arms and duelling. On presenting himself before
Maximian, he met with a reception suitable to his quality,
and had the greatest honours paid him of any that were
about him. There happened to be at that time a great
contest between Maximian and the two emperors, Gratian
and Valentinian, on account of his being refused the third
part of the empire, which he demanded. When, therefore,
Mauricius saw Maximian ill-treated by the emperors, he took
' occasion from thence to address him in this manner: “Why
need you, Maximian‚ stand in fear of Gratian, when you have
so fair an opportunity of wresting the empire from him?
Come with me into Britain, and you shall take possession

⁶ Maximus is the tonect name of this usurpet.
