The exact route from London ιο Winchcster not being defined, we may
suppose that it ran, as before, through Silchester, and from thence by
St. Mary Boume, as in the lbth Iter. From winchester, as the rond still
exists leading ιο Old Sarum, the distance of eleven miles will probably
give the site of Brige, although the station itself is not known; and the
nine following will lead us to Old Sarum. Pursuing the course of the
rond, which may be still traced quite to Dorchester‚ mmains found on
Guasage Cow Down point out the site of Ventagcludiay and the disagres-
ment between tha Itinerary and real dimnce from thence to Dorchester
justifies us in supposing that some intermediate post has been omitted.
'l'he site of Moridunum is doubtfu13 some thinking it to be Eggerdon, or
the Hill of the Morini, with which the distance of nine miles would not
disagree3 while others, with more reason, prefer Seston, the great port oi
the West, because the Foss leads from llchester directly ιο it. intermediate
statIons have evidently been lost between this place and Exeter, as has also
been the csse between that place and the Dart‚ the Tumor, the Fowey aud
thc Fal From Honitonthc rood is visible pointing to Exeter, as well u
horn Exeter to Totuess, aud according ιο the ingenious Borlase, even to
Isostwithlel.
