underteok the ordering of whatever related to it As soon
as the king was invented with hia royal habilimente, he wa·
conducted in great pomp to the metropolitan chnrch, sup·
ported on each side by two archbishops, and having four
kings, viz. cf Albania, Oomwall, Demetia, dVencdotia,
whose right it was, bearing four golden swords before him.
He was also attended with a concert of all sorts of music,
which made most excellent harmony. On another part war
the queen, dressed out in her richest ornaments, conducted
by the archbishcps and bishops to the Temple of Virgins3
the four queens also of the kings last mentioned, bearing
before her four white doves according to ancient custom3
and after her there followed a retinue of women, making al]
imaginable demonstratione of joy. When the whole procession
was ended, so transponting was the harmcny of the musica
instrumenta and voices, whereof there was a vast variety in
both churches, that the knights who attended were in doubt

solemnity, though the whole day had been spent in it. At

and queen put off their crowns, and putting on their lighter
ornaments, went to the banquet; he to one palace with the

and women used to celebrate their festivals apart. When
they had all taken their seats according to precedence Caius
the sewer, in rich robes of ermine, with a thousand young
noblemen, all in like manner clothed with ermine, served up
the dishes. From another part, Bedver the butler was
followed with the same number of attendants, in various
habits, who waited with all kinds of cups and drinking
vessels. In the queen's palace were innumerabis waiters,
dressed with variety of omaments‚ all performing their
respective cffices; which if I should describe particularly,
Ishould draw out the history to a tedicus length For at
that tim0 Britain had arrived at such a pitch of grandeur,
that in abundance of riches, luxury of ornamenta, and polite.-
ness of inhabitants, it far surpassed all other kingdoms. The
