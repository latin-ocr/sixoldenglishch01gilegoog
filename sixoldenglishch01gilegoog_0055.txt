But duke Ethelwulf met them, and though his troops ware
few, their hearts resided in brave dwellings: they point
their darts, they rout the enemy, and triumph in abundant
spoils. At length four days after their maeting, Ethelrsd
arrives with his army3 an indescribable battle is fought,
now these, now those urge on the fight with spears immove-
able; duhe Ethclwulf falls, who ashort time before had
obtained the victory: the barbarians at last triumph. Tre
body of the above-named duke is privately withdrawn, and
carried into the province of the Mercians, to a place called
Northworthig, but Derby in the language of the Danes.
Four days after king Ethelred with his brother Alfrcd fought
again with all the army of the Danas at AEscesdune 3* and
there was great slaughter on both sides: but at last king
Ethehed obtained the victory. But it is proper thatI should
declare the names of those chiefs who fell there: Bagsac
king, the veteran Sidrac their consul, the younger sidrac
also, the consul Osbern, the consul Frena, the consul Harold3
and, so to speak, all the flower of the barbarian youth was
there slain, so that neither before nor since was ever such

destruction known since the Saxone first gained Britain by ,

their arms.

Fourteen days after, they again took courage and a second
battle was fought at a place called Basingt the barbarians
came and took part over against them ; the fight began, and
hope passed from the one side to the other3 tho royal
army was deceivad, the enemy had the victory, but gained no

poFurthermore after two months the aforesaid king Ethelrsd
renewcd the battle, and with him was his brother Alfred, at
Merton, against all the army of the barbarians, anda largo
number was slain on both sides. The barbariam obtained
the victory ; bishop Heahmund there fell by the sword, and
his body lies buried at angineshammc.† Many others also
fell or fled in that battle, concerning whom it seems to be a
loss of time to speak more minutely at present Lastly,
after the above-mentioned battle, and aster the Easter of tho
same year, died king Ethehed, from whose family I derivo

my origin.
