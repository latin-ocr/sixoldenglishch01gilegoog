Bur the besieged, standing on the top of the walls, were no
lese vigorous to repel the force of the enemies’ engines, and
assault them with their own, and cast forth darts and fire·
brands with a unanimous resolution to make a valiant de·
sense. And when a breach was made through the wall,
they compelled the enemy to retire, by throwing upon them
fire and scalding water. But being distressed through
scarcity of provision and daily labour, they sent au urgent¹
message to Brutus, to hasten to their assistente, for they
were afraid they might be so weakened as to be obliged to
quit the town. Brutus, though desirous of relieving them,
was under great perplexity, as he had not men enough to
stand a pitched battle, and therefore made use of a strata·
gem, by which he proposed to enter the enemies’ camp by
night, and having deceived their watch to kill them in their
sleep. But because he knew this was impraoticable without
the concurrence and assistance of some Greeks, he called to
him Anacletus, the companion of Antigonus, and with a
drawn sword in his hand, spake to him after this manner :-
“ Noble youth! your own and Antigonus's life is now at
an end, unless you will faithfully perform what I command

Imay have the easier access to the rest. Do you therefore
manage this affair cunningly. At the second honr of the
night go to the watch, and with fair speeohes tell them that
you have brought away Antigonus from prison, and that he
is come to the bottom of the woods, where he lies hid among
the shrubs, and cannot get any further, by reason of the
fetters with which you shall pretend that he is bound.
Then you shall conduct them, as if it were to deliver him,
to the end of the wood‚ where I will attend with a band of
men ready to kill them.”
