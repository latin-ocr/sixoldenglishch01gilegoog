Uron the death of Constantine, a dissension arose among the
nobility‚ about a successor to the throne. Some were for
setting up Aurelius Ambrosius3 others Uther Pendragon;
others again some other persons of the royal family. At last,
when they could come to no conclusion, Vortigern, consul
'of the Gewisseans, who was himself very ambitious of the
crown‚ went to Constans the monk,* and thus addressed
himself to him: “You see your father is dead, and your
brothers on account of their age are incapable of the govern-
ment; neither do I see any of your family besides yourself,
whom the people ought to promote to the kingdom. If you
will therefore follow my advice, I will, on condition of your

increasing my private estate, dispose the people to favour ’

your advancement, and free you from that habit, notwith-
standing that it is against the rule of your order.'’ Constans,
overjoyed at the proposal promised, with an ooth, that upon
these terms he would grant him whatever he would desire.
Then Vortigern took him, and investing him in his regal
habiliments, conducted him to London, and made him king,
though not with the free consent of the people. Arch-
bishop Guethelin was then dead, nor was there any other
that durat perform the ceremony of his unction‚ on account
of his having quitted the monastic order. However, this
proved no hindrance tobis coronation, for Vortigern himself
performed the ceremony instead of a bishop.
