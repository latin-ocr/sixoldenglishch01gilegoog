ξ 108. What need many words? ‘Tm example of Mat·
thias is apparently laid before you for your confusion, who
was choscn into his place, not by his own proper will, but
by the election of the holy apostles, or rather the judgrnent
of Christ, whereat ye being hlinded, do not perceive how far
ye run astray from his menits, while ye fall wilfully and‘

It is therefore manifest that he who wittingly from his heart

good work.” Ye do mightily covet a hishopric in respect of
avarice‚ hut not for spiritual convenience and for the good
work which is suitable to the place, ye want it. “ It behoveth
therefore such a one to he free from all cause of reprehension.”
At this saying we have more need to shed tears than utter—
