474 arcerano or crannonem

Such en itinerary, but varying in many respecta from thet ot An·
ioniae,is one of the most important parte of the worlr now praecarer to the
reeder.

In fixing the sites of the towns specified in these Itinersries, our anti·
quanee bave mumed the most unjuetifiable latitude. 'l'be mres resem·
blance of a name was considered ae a reason sufficient to outwsigh all
, otbere; even the great Camden suffered himself to be misled bythiere·
semblanoe, in fixing Ariconium st Kentcheeter, Camulodunum at Maidon,
Bennavenne st Beneford‚ Pons AElii et Pont Eland, and atr-Pontem at
Paunton. 'l'be explanation of the names to suit the supposed situation ¹
has been another fruitful source of error 3 not only Britiah and Latin, but
Saxon, Greek, and even Hebron, bave been exhaueted to discover signifi-
osnt appellatione 3 and where one language was not sufficient, belf a sord
has been horrowed from one language and half from another to support
s favonrite hypothesis* 'rho commentary now presented to the readerie
founded on the following principles.

Ι. The vestiges of roade actually exieting are mken as much as possible
for guides; and tbe extremes or direction of eeeh Iter, ascertained from
two or more undoubted statione, or other unequivocal proofs.

11. in general, no place is regarded as the site of a Roman station,
unless fixed Roman remaine, such ae buildings, bathe, tre. are found at or
near it; and unless it ie situated on or near the line of a Roman road.

111. An exception has, however, been sometimes unavoidably made to
this rule. After tbe Romane had established their power, aad completed
their system of internal communication, they undoubtedly lessened the
number of their garrieons, to avoid either too grenta division of their force,
ortoreduoe that part of it which vas necessarily mtionmy. Hence we
heve sometimes considered the direction of tbe rond, and the general die·
tance, as sufficient deta fordetermining a station or statione, either when they
nere situated between two considerable fortified points, or when covered
by others on every side 3 because it is probable such poete were merely tem·
ffirary, and vvere dilapidated or demolished, even before the decline of the

man power.

IV. In assigning a specillo Romen nemeto a ploce, ithae not been
deemed sufficient that fixed antiquitiee or other equivalent evidence prove a
town to bave existed on the spot, unless the order of tbe names, and tlte
distances marked in the Itinerary, justify the appellation.

V. Where the line of the Roman road is tolerably perfect, no station ie
sougbt far fnom it, except where the excess of the Itirrerary over tha real
gistance, or accurate measurement, affords sufficient authority for the

eriation.

VI. 'l'he numbers which determine the distances being written in Roman

numerals, which gave great latitudo for error-t· and substitutione, recouree
irae been had to this rule.

⁸ On this subject it mey not be improper to observa, that the name of
Castor, Gestar, or Chester, generally points outa Roman station 3 and Sem,
street, Stane arrd Stans, (Strat, and Stan, when compounded) ae generally
ehov the course of a Britiah or Roman way.

t· For example these marlae '⁰⁸ ⁸, beirrg the mutilated parts or* numerale,
night have been easily mansformed by the copyist inso1111Lx111.vt11.
