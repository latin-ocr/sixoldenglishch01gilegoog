But just as they were upon rushing into the lists, Arthur
hastily got up, and guarding himself with his shield, advauc
with speed against Flollo. And now they renewed the
assault with great tage, eagerly bent upon one another's
destruction. At length Flollo, watching his advantage, gave
Arthur a blow upon the forchead, which might have proved
mortal, had he not blunted the edge of his weapon against
the helmet. When Arthur saw his coat of mail aud shield 'l
red with blood, he was inflamed with still greater rage‚ and l
lifting up his Caliburn with his utmost strength struck it ,
through the helmet into Flollo's head, and made a terrible ;
gash. With this wound Flollo fell down, tearing the ground
with his spurs, and expired. As soon as this news was]
spread through the army, the citizens ran together, and open-
ing the gates, surrendered the city to Arthur. After the
victory, he divided his army into two parts ; one of which ho
committed to thc conduct of Hoel, whom he ordered to march
against Guitard, commender of the Pictavians3 while he
with the other part should endeavour to reduce ¹the other

also destroyed Gascony with fire and sword, and subdued
the princes of it. At the end of nine years, in which time

⁴ lt is wonderful that the contenta of this book should ever have passed
