selvas, and let our country owe its deliverance to ,heir own
civil brorls. No saith is to be kept with one that is treach-
erous, and is continually laying snares for him tc whom he
owes fidelity. Such have the Saxone always been tc our
nation, from the very first time of their coming am'ong us.
What saith ought we to keep with them ἲ Let Penda'imme·
diatcly have leave to go against 0swy, that by this civil die·
sension and destruction of one another, our island may get
rid of them.

ΒΥ these and other words to the same effect, Cadwalla was
prevailed upon to grant the permission desired. And Penda,
having assembled avast army, went to the Humber, and
laying waste that country, began a fierce war upon the king.
Oswy was at last reduced to such extremity‚ that he was
forced to promise him innumerable royal ornaments, and
other presents more than one would believe, if he would
desist- from ruining his country, and return home without
committing any more hostilities. But when the other could

by no entreaties be prevailed upon to do it, the king, in hopes ·

of divine assistance, though he had aless army, however,
gave him battle near tha River Winwid, and having killed
Peuda and thirty other commandere, gained the victory.
Penda's son Wulfred, by a grant from Cadwalla, succeeded
to the kingdom, and joining with Eafa and Eadbert, two
leaders of the Mercians, rebelled against Oswy3 but at last,
by Cadwalla's command, made peace with him. At length,
after forty-eight years were expired, that most noble and
potent king of the Britons, Cadwalla, being grown infirm with
age and sickness, departed this life upon the fifteenth before
the kalende of December, The Britons embulmed his body,
and placed it with wonderful art in a brazen statue, which
was cast according to the measure of ‚his stature. This
statue they set up with complete armour, ou an admirable and
beautiful brazen horse, over the western gate of London, for
a monument of the above-mentioned victory, and for a terror
to the Saxone. They also built under it a church in honour
of St. Martin, in which divine ceremonias are celebrated for
him aud the others who departed in the faith.
