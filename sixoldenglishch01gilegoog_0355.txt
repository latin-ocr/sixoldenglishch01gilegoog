shall, together with the malady itself, from day to day, come
forth out 01 1100.” And listen 0100 what the prophet Zacha-
0101110 00001 «1010100100, menaced 10 Joasb, the king 01

he will also leave you.'’

§ 42. What shall I mention 01 100101, 110 first and chief
01 110 00001010, who beginneth his prophecy‚ or rather
vision, in this way: ‘⁴ Hear, Ο ye heavens, and 01100 00011
