Ilm years nster thls, Maximian, proud os the vast mensures
“ that daily flowed in upon him, fitted out a grem lieet, aud
resembled together all the forces in Britain. For this king·
dom was now not sufficient for him; he was ambitious ol

adding Gaul also to it. With this view he set sail, and

arrived first at the kingdom of Armorica, now called Bran ’

tagne, and began hostilities upon the Gallio people that
inhabited it. But the Gauls, under the command ο1 Im·
baltus‚ met him, and engaged him in battle, in which the
greater part being in danger, they were forced to fly, and
leave Imbaltus with filteen thousand men killed, ull of them
Armoricans. This severe overthrow was matter of the
greatest joy to Maximian, who knew the reductiones that
country would be very easy, ¹after the loss of so many men.
Upon this occasion he called Conan aside from the army,
and smiling said :-“ See, we have already conquered one of
the best kingdoms in Gaulr we may now have hopes of
gaining all the rest. Let us make haste to take the cities
and towns, before the rumour of their danger spread to the
remoter parts of Gaul, and raise all the people up in arms.
For if we can but get possession of this kingdom, I make no
doubt of reducing all Gaul under our power. Be not there·
fore concerned that you have yielded up the island ο1
Britain to me, notwithstanding the¹ hopes you once had of
succeeding to it3 because whatever you have lost in it, I
will restore to you in this country. For my design is to
advanoe you to the throne of this kingdom3 and this shall
be another Britain, which we will people with our own

countrymen, and drive out the old inhabitants. The landis ,

1111111111 in corn, the rivers abound with fish, the woods
afford a beautiful prospect, and the forests are everywhere
pleasant3 noris there in my opinion anywhere a more de·
lightful country.'' Upon this, Conan, with a submissius

bow, gave him his thanks‚ and promised to continue loyal to , ,

himas long as helived.
