within some words afterwards: “And all nations shall
understand, that the house of Israel are led captive away

for their offences, because they have forsaken me. AndI
have turned my face from them, and yielded them over into
the hands of their enemies, and all have perished by the
sword3 according unto their unclean sins, and after their
iniquities have I dealt with them, and turned my face away
from them! ·

ξ 62. This which I have spoken may suffice concerning
the threats of the holy prophets: only I have thought it
necessary to intermingle in this little work of mine, not only
these menaces, but also a few words horrowed out of the
wisdom of solomon, to declare unto kings matters of exhor·
tation or instruction, that they may not say I am willing to⁴
load the shoulders of men with heavy and insupportable
burdens of words, but not so much as once with mine own
finger (that is, with speech of consolation) to move the same.

For these men without respect do tempt (iod, whose com·

do they keep to him their faith, unto whose oracles be they
pleasing‚ or somewhat severe, they turn their backs and not
their faces. “For perverse thoughts do separate from God,''
and this in the tyrants of our time very plainly appeareth.
But why doth our meanness intermeddle in this so manifest
a determination? Lea therefore him who ’alone is true (as
we have said) speak for us, I mean the Holy Ghost, of whom
it is now prouounced‚ “The Holy Ghost verily will avoid
the counterfeiting of discipline.” And again, “Because thu
