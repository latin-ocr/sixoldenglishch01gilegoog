persecutore, and patience on the part of the suffering saints,
ecclesiastioal history informs us; for the whole ohuroh were
orowding in a body, to leave behind them the dark things
of this world, and to make the best of their way to thr
happy mansions of heaven, as if to their proper home.

ξ 10. Gon, therefore, who wishes all men to be saved, and
who calls sinners no less than those who think themselves
righteous, magnified his mercy towards us, and, as we know,
during the above-named persecution, that Britain might not
totally be enveloped in the dark shades of night, he, of his
own free gift, kindled up among us bright luminaries of holy
martyra, whose places of burial andos martyrdom had they
not for our manifold crimes been interfered with and de·
stroyed hythe barbarians, would have still kindled in the
minds of the beholders no small fire of divine oharity. Such
were St. Alban of Verulam, Aaron and Julius. citizens ol

Carlisle,* and the rest, of both sexes, who in different placas
stood their ground in the Christian contest.

ξ 11. The first of these martyra, St Alban, for oharity's

in his house, and then by chauging clothes with him, imita·
ting in this the example of Christ, who laid down his life
lor his sheep, and exposing himself in the other's clothes to
be pursued in his stead. So pleasing to God was this con·
duct, that between his confession and martyrdom, he was
honoured with the performanoe of wonderful miracles in
presence of the impious blasphemans who were carrying the
Roman standards, and like the Israelites of old, who trol
dry·foot an unfrequented path whilst the ark of the oove·
nant stood some time on the sands in the midst of Jordant
so also the martyr, with a thousand others, opened a path
across the noble river Thames‚ whose waters stood abrupt
like precipioes on either side3 and seeing this, the first oi
his executore was strichen with awe, and from a wolf became
a lamb ; so that he thirsted for martyrdom, and boldly un·
derwent that for which he thirsted. The other holy martyra
were tormented with divers sufferings‚ and their limbs wera
raoked in such uuheard of ways, that they, without dclay,
erected the trophies of their glorious martyrdom even in ths
