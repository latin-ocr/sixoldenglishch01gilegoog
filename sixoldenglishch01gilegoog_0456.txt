Britain. They stopped travellers and merchants, and eom·
pelled them to relate what they had heard, or knew, worthy
of notice. Τὴε common people usually surrounded foreign
merchants in the towns, arrd obliged them to tell from whenoe
they came, and what curious things they had observed. On
such vagno reperte they often rashly acted, and thessere
generally deceived3 for many answered them agreeably to
their desires with fictitious stories.⁶

which they prized during life, even arms and animals, were
thrown into tlpe funeral pile. A heap of earth and turf formed
the sepulchre.

⁸ As tle classic authors have left us no description of the modes of irr-
iennent among tho Britons, Richard was induced, hythe conformityoi
their manners and customs to those of the Gauls, to adopt the words used
by Caesnr in his account of the Gallie funerals Unfortunately the remains
of the British barris afford little assistance in supplying this deficiency. lt
appears, however, that the Britons raised tumuli over their dead, and
continued the practice till aster the introduction of Christianity; and
that their other modes of interment were the camd, or heap of stenes 3
the cistoaen, or stone chest; and perhaps the nomia, or hanging
stone. From a curious fragment commemorating the graves of the
British amors, which is printed in the first volume of the Welch Archa·
ology‚ we learn further, that they huried their dead on the topos hills end
lofty clitis, on declivities, in heaths and secluded valleys, on thebanis sud
near the fords of rivers, and on the sea-shore “where the ninth wass
breaks.·' Allusions are also made to corresponding stones raised on these
graves 3 and it is said, “ the long graves in Gwanas, no one knovn to whom
they belong nor what is their history.'’

As the modes of intermeat among all early nations were in many re·
spects similar, there is perhaps no part of our national antiquities whichhss
given scope to so much conjecture es this. 'l'he reader who is desirous of
more particular information relative to this subject, may at lerrst find
amusement in eonsulting the works of Stukeley, Douglss's Nauia Britan·
