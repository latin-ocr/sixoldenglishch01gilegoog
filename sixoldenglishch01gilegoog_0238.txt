been so often defeated by him. He therefore promised them
the victory, and that they should come off safer, considering
the superiority of their number, which amounted to two

who all went unarmed. From that conspiracy God was
pleased to deliver me, by throwing a stake in my way, where·
with 1 defended myself and escaped.” Thus spoke Eldol.
'rhen Aurelius exhorted his companions to place all their
hope in the Son of God, and to make a brave assault with
one consent upon the enemy, in defence of their country.
Nor was Hengist less busy on the other hand in forming his
troops, and grving them directions how to behave themselves
