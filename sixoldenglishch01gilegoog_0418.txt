S 15. According to the most learned among the Soots, if
any one desires to learn what I am now going 10 state,
Ireland was a desert, and uninhabited, when the children of
Israel crossed the Red Sea, in which, as we read in the
Book of the Low, the Egyptians who followed them were
drowned At that period, there lived among this people,
with a numerous family, a Scythian of noble birth, who had
been banished from his country, and did not go to pursus

the people of God. Τ110 Egyptians who were left, seeing ,

the destruction of the great men of their nati0n‚ and fearing
lest he should possess himself of their territory, took counsel

’ together, and expelled him. Thus reduced, he wandered

sorry-two years in Africa, and arrived, with his family, at
the altars of the Philistinea by the Lake of Osiers. Then
passing between Rusicada and the hilly country of Syria
they travelled by the river Malva through Mauritania as far
as the Pillars of Hercules; and crossing the Tyrrhena Sea,
landed in Spain, where they continued many years, having
greatly increased and multiplied. Thence‚athousandandtw0
years after the Egyptians were lost in the Red Sea, they passed
into Ireland‚ and the district of Dalrieta* At that period, Bru·
tus, who first exercised the consular office, reigned over the
Romans3 and the state, which before was governed by regal
power, was afterwards ruled‚ during four hundred and forty·
seven years, by consuls, tribunes of the people, and dictatore.

The Britons came 10 Britain in the third ageof the world,
and in the fourth, the Scots took possession of Ireland.

The Britons who, suspecting no hostilities, were un·
provided with the means of defence, were unanimously and
incessantly attacked, both by the Scots from the west, and
by the Picts from the north. A long interval after this, the
Romans obtained the empire of the world.
