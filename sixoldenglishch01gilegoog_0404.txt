For which cause it is written, Be ye holy, bocum 1 am
holy.” Which one of you, Ι pray, hath with his whole
mind so pursued sanctity‚ that he hath earnestly haatened, as
much as in him lay, to fulfil the same? But let us behold
what in the second lesson of the same apostle is containedr
“My decrest,” saith he, “sanctify your souls for tho
obediente of saith, through the Spirit, in charity, in brother·
hoodJ loving one another out of a true heart perpetually‚ as
horn again not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
through the word of God‚ living and remaining for
ever.''

d 107. These are truly the commandments of the apostlea
and read in the day of your ordination, to the end ye should
inviolahly observo the same, hut they are not fultilled by you
in discretiori and judgment, nay not so much as duly con·
sidered or understood. And afterwards: “Laying therefore
aside all melica, and all densita, and dissemblings, envy, and
detractions, as infants newly born, reasonable and without
guile covet ye milk, that ye may thereby grew to salvation
because our Lord is sweet.” Consider ye also in your minda
if these sayings which have sounded in your deas ears have
not often likewise been trodden by you under footz and
again: “Ye truly are the chosen lineage‚ the royal priest-
hood, the holy nation‚ the people for‘adoption that ye may
declare his virtues who hath called you out of darkness into .
his marvellous light.” But truly by you ane not only the
virtues of God not declared and made more glorious, but also
through your wicked exemplos are they (by such ae hove not
perfect belief) despised. Ye have perchance at the same time
likewise heard, what is read in the lesson of the Acts, on
this wisc: “Peter arising in the midst of the disciples saidr
Men and brethren‚ it is expedient that the Scriptura be
fulfilled, which the Holy Ghost heth by the mouth of David
foretold of Judas.” And a little after: “This man therefore
lltsslttltffsfsf? tltlftfjfllft alltltflss
reading thereof nothing at all appertained unto yourselves.
What one of you (I pray you) doth not seek the field of the
reward of iniquity? For Judn rohbed and pillaged the
porse, and ys spoil and waste the sacred gifts and mures
of the ehurch‚ together with the souls of her children. Hs·
