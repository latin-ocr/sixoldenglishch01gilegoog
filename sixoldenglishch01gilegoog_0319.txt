As soon as Ivor and Ini had got together their ships, they
with all the forces they could raise, arrived ιιι the island, and
sor forty- nme years toget ther fieroely attached the nation oi
the Angles‚ but to little purpose. For the above-mentioned
mortality and famine, together with the inveterate spirit oi
faction that was among them, had made this proud people so
much degenerate, that they were not able to gain any advan-
tage of the enemy. And being now also overrun with bar·
barism, they were no longer called Britons, but Gualenses,
Welshmen ; a word derived either from Gualo their leader,
or Guales their queen, or from their barbarism. But the
Saxone managed affairs with more prudence, maintained
peace and concord among themselves, tilled their grounds
rebuilt their cities and towns, and so throwing off the domi·
nion of the Britons, bore sway over ull Loegria, under their
leeder Athelstan, who first wore a crown amongst them.
But the Welshmen, being very much degenerated from the
nobility of the Britons, never after recovered the monarchy
of the island; on the contrary, by quarrels among themselves
and wars with the Saxons, their country was a perpetual
scene of misery and slaughter. '

Huntingdon. But I advise them to be silent concerning the
kings of the Britons, since they have not that book written
