iore us is valuable ; for tho great mass of scholare have come
to the decided conviction that it issull of fables. Bnt itis
the romantio character which pervades the narrative, together
with its acknowlodged antiquity, which make it desirablc
that the hook should not sink into oblivion. Those who
desire to possess it as avencrablerclic of an early age, will now
have an opportunity of gratifying their wish; whilst others,
who despise it os valueless, in their researches after historio
truth, may, neverthelesS, lind some little pleesure in the tales
of imagination which it contains.

The value of this work is best evinced hythe attention
which was paid to it for many centuries3 Henry of Hunt-
ingdon made an abstract of it, which he subjoined as an
appendix to his history: and Alfred of Bevcrley, a later
writer, in his abridgment, of this work which still exista,
has omitted Geoffrey's name, though he calls the author οἰ

Aaron Thompson, of Quaen's Collega, Oxlord, [8vo. Lond.
1718,] and lately revised and reprinted by the editor of this
volume. [8v0. Lond. 1842] A long preface ia prefixed to
that translation, wherein the author endeavoured to prove
Geoffrcy of Moumouth to be a more faithful historian than

which they think had better been suppressed and buried in

less and fabulous story, such as our modern historians think
not worthy relating, or at least mention with contempt And
though it is true, several men, and those of learning too,
censure this book who have but little considered it, and
whose studies no ways qualify them to judgc ot' it; yet, I
own this consideration has for a long time deterred me from
publishing it: and Ι should not at last have been able to
surmount this difficulty, without the importunity and cn-

had indeed before 1 entered upon the work perusod the prin·
cipal writers both for and against this history, the effect of
which upon my own judgment, as to the swaying it to the
