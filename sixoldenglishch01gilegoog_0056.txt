And now Ι have followed up my plan, dear cousin Matilda,
and will begin to consolidate my subject; aud like a ship
which, having sailed a long way over thewaves, already
occupies the port, to which in her patient voyage she had
been tending: so we, like sailors, are already catering, and
as 1 briefiy intimated to you in my former epistle. so also m
the presaces to this present book, and without any impro-
priety I again remiud you, and though I cut short the course
of that which is visionary, not impclled by necessity, but
through love of your affection, I now send it you again more
fully to be meditated upon conceming the origin of our
family, and sufficiently embrace the study of your sincerity!

Thus far then: I will now leave obscurity and begin to
speak concerniug the sons of Ethelwulf. They were five in
number: the first was Ethelstan, who also shared the king·
dom with his father: the second was Ethelbald, who also
was king of the Westem English: the third was Ethelbert,
king of Kent: the fourth was Ethelred, whoafter the death
of Ethelbert succoeded to the kingdom, and was also my
grandfather’s grandfather: the fifth was Alfred, who suc·
oceded after all the others to tha whole sovereignty‚ aud was
your grandfather's grandfather. Wherefore I make known
to you, my beloved cousin Matilda, that I receive these things
from ancient tradition, and have taken care in most brief
style to write the history of our racc down to these two
kings, from whom we have taken our origin. To you there-
fore, most beloved, Idevote this work, compelled by the love
of our relationship: if others receive them with haughtiness,
they will be judged unworthy of the feast ; if otherwise, we
advise all in charity to gather what is set before them. Lot
us return then to the story that we broke off, and to the
death of the above-named Ethelred His reign lasted flve
years, and he is buried in the monastery which goes by the
name of Wimbome.

Cane. Ill-os the reign os king Alsrod.
Α 871. After these things, Alfred obtained the kingdom
when his brothers were deod-he also was the youngest son
¹of king Ethelwulf-over all the provinces of Britain.

⁹ 1 must again request the rander to pardon the ohscurity which so fra.
qusntly occurs in our anthor's style, and my inability to deal with meh pu·
ngas ς tho above ’1 amlmbly alosa mansion of the original.
