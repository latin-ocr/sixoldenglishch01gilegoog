'glorious light of truth and humility. A Christian, and he
not mean, hut e perfect one, and apriest not base, but one oi
the highest, a martyr of no ordinary sort, but one of the
ehiefest, saith: “Now 1 begin to be the disciple of Christ”
And you, like the same Lucifer, who was thrown down out
of heaven, ere puffed up with words, and not with power,
and after a sort do ohew under the tooth, and make pretence
in your actions, as the author of this your wiokedness hath
thus expressed: “I will mount up into the heavens, end be
like unto the Highest.” And again: “I have digged and
drunk water, end dried up with the steps of my feet all the
rivers of the banks.'’ You would more rightly have
imitated him and hearkened unto his words, who is without

the prophet saith, “Why do earth and ashes swell with
ride ?'’
p d 75. But let us return unto our subject. Which of you,
Ι say, like Polycarp, the famous bishop of the churoh ol
Smyrna, that witness of Christ, hath courteously entertained
as guests at his table, those who violently drew him out to
be burned? and when for the eharity which he did bear
unto Christ, he was brought to the stake, said, “He who
gave me graoe to endure the torment of the fire, will
likewise grant me without fastening of nails to bear the
flames with patience.” And now passing over in this my
discourse the mighty armies of saints, 1 will yet touch on
one only, for example’s sake, Basil the bishop of Caeseria,
who when he was thus by the unrighteous prinoe threatened
that, unless he would on the next day be as the rest, detiled
in the dirty duughill of the Arian heresy, he should he put
