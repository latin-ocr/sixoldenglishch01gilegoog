amongst other things the standard called Raven3 for they
say that the three sistere of Hingwar and Hubba, daughters
of Lodobroch, wove that flag and got it ready in one day.

Δ The same year, after Easter, king Alfred, with afew fol-
lowers, made for himself a stronghold in a place called
Athelney, and from thence sallied with his vessels and the'
nobles of Somersetshire, to make frequent assaults upon the
pagans. Also, in the seventh week after Easter‚ he rode to
the stone of Egbert,l which is in the eastern part of the wood
which is called Selwood,† which means in Latin Silva Magna,
the Great Wood, but in British Coit-mawr. Here he was met
by all the neighbouring folk of Somersetshire, and Wiltshire,
and Hampshire‚ who had not, for fear of the pagane, flod

great tribulation‚ they received him, as he deserved, with joy
and acclamations, and encamped there for one night. When
the following day dawned, the king struck his camp, and
went to Okely,‡ where he encamped for one night. The
next morning he removed to Edington‚ and there fought
bravely and perseveringly against all the army of the pagens,

and ursued them flying to their fortification. Immediately
he slew all the men, and carried off all the booty that ho

siege to with all his army3 and when he had been there
fourteen days, the pagens, driven by famine, cold, ferar, and
last of all by despair, asked for peace, on the condition that
they should give the king as many hostages as he pleased,
but should receive none of him in return, in which form they
