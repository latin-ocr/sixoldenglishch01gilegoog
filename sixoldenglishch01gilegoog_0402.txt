Ye pereeive therefore upon what offences the wrath oi God
doth chiefly arise. ’

S 104. In which respect hear lihewise what the same
holy apostle, witha prophetical spirit, foretelleth of you, and
such as yourselves, writing plainly in this sort to Timothyr
“For know you this, that in the last days there shall be
dangerous times at hand. For men shall be sels-lovers,
eovetous, puffed up, proud, blasphemus, disobedient to their
parents, ungrateful, wichad, without affection, incontinent,
unmeeh, without benignity, betrayers, froward, lofty, rather
lovers of sensual pleasures, than os God, haring a show of
piety‚ but renouncing the virtue thereof.” Avoid thou these
men, even as the prophet saith: “I have hated the con·
gregation of the malicious, and with the wiched -1 will not
sit.” And a little after, he uttereth that (which in our age
we behold to increase), saying: “ Ever learning, and never
attaining unto the knowledge of truth3 for even as dannes
and Mambres resisted Moses, so do these also withstand the
truth: men corrupted in mind, reprobate against saith, but
they shall prosper no further; for their folly shall be manifest
nuto all, as theirs lihewise was.”

5 105. And evidently doth he also deelare how priests in
their office ought to beheve themselves, writing thus to
Titus: “ Show thyself an example of good works, in
learning, in integrity, in gravity, having thy word sound
without cliente, that he who standeth on the adverse part
may be afraid, having no evil to spealr of us.” And moreover
he seith unto Timothy, “Labour thou as a good soldier of
Christ Jesus; no man fighting in God's quarrel entangleth
himself in worldly business, that he may please him unte
whom he hath approved himself 3 for whose striveth in the
lists ior the mastery‚ receiveth not the erown, unless he heth
lawfully contended.'' This is his exhortation to the good.¹

. Other matt-er also which the same epistles contain, isa

threatening advertisement to the wicked (such as yourselves,
in the j udgment of all understanding persona, appear to be).
“Il' any one,” saith he, “teacheth otherwise, and doth not
peaeeably assent tc the sound sayings of our Lord Jesus
Christ, and that doctrine which is according to piety‚ he is
proud, having no knowledge, butlanguishing about questions,
and contentione ol words, out ot' which do spring envies.
