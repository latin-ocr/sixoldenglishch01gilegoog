creaturos, speaketh 01 wickod offenders, nato whom pitil'ully
lamenting beforehand the scourge that hung over lsrael, our
Lord doth say, “Τοο far hath the iniquity 01 the house 01
Israel aud J udah prevailed‚ because the earth is filled with
iniquity and uncleanness. Behold 1 am, mine eyes shall not
spara, nor will 1 take pity.” And afterwards, “Because the
earth is replenished with people‚ and the city franghted with
iniquity, Iwill also turn away the force 01 their power, and
their holy things shall he polluted, prayer shall approach and
sue 101 peace, and it shall not he obtained” And somewhat
alter, “ The word 01 our Lord‚ quoth he, was spoken unto me,
saying‚ Thou son of man, the land that shall so far sin against
me as to commit an offence‚ I will stretch forth my hand upon
her, and break in pisces her foundation 01 breed, and send
upon her famine, and take away mankind and cattle from her3
and is these three men, Noah, Daniel, and Job, be in the
midst 01 her, they shall not deliver her, but they in their
justice shall bs saved, saith our Lord. 11 so bs that also 1
shall bring in evil 1111111 upon the land and punish her, she
lihewise shall he turned to destruction, and there shall not be
one who shall have free passage from the 111101 the beasts,
and although these three men are in the midst 01 her, usI
live, saith our Lord, their sons and daughters shall not be
preserved, but they alone shall be saved, and as 101· the land
it shall fall to confinior? And again, “The son shall not
receive the unrighteousness 01 the father, neither the father
the son’s unrighteousness. The justice 01 the just shall be
upon himself. And the nujust man, if he turneth him away
from all the iniquities which hc hath done, and keepeth all
my commandments, and doth justice and abundance 01 mercy‚
he shall live in life and shall not die All his sins, whatsoever
he heth committed, shall have no further being; he shall live
the life in his own justice which he hath performed. DoI
with my will voluntarily wish the death 01 the unrighteous
saith our Lord‚ rather than that he should return from his
evil wey and live? But when the just shall turn himself
away from hls justice, and do iniquity, according to all the
iniquities whloh the umighteous hath committed, all the just
actions (which he hath done) shall remain no further in
memory. In his offense wherain he hath fallen, and in his

sins in which hs hath transgresssd, 110 shall die.” And,
