he might more safely oppose the invasion 01 the enemy.
“ Have not 11011 all things to your disposal 2* said constans‘
“ Do what you will 00 10 that, 00 that they be but faithful a,
me.” Vortigem replied‚ “l am informed that the Picta are
going to bring the Dacians and Norwegians in upon 00, with
0 design to give us very great annoyance. I would therefore
advise you, and in my opinion it is the best course you can
take, that yon maintain some Ρ1010 10 your court, who may
do you good service among those 01 that nation. For 11 11
10 true that they are preparing 10 begin a rebellior, you may
employ them 00 00100 upon their countrymen in their plots
and stratagema, so 00 easily 10 escape them.’' This was the
dark treason 01 0 secret enemy; for he did not recommend
this 00101 regard 10 the safety 01 Constans, but because he
knew the Ρ1010 10 be 0 giddy people, and ready for all

luxurious table, insomuch that they looked upon him 00 the
king. So great was the regard they had for him, that they
made songs 01 him about the streets, the subject 01 which
was, that Vortigem deserved the government, deserved the
sceptro 01 Britain3 but that Constans was unworthy 01 it.
This encouraged Vortigem 10 show them still more favour,
in order the more firmly to engage them in his interest ; and
when by these practices he had made them entirely his
creaturos, he took 00 opportunity, when they were drunk, to
tell them, that he was going to retireont 01 Britain, to 00011
he could get 0 better estate; for the small revenue he had
then, he said, would not so much as enable him 10 maintain a
retinue 01 fifty men. Then putting on 0 look 01 sadness, he
