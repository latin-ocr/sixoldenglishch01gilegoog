cris. I.-Julius Cesar invades Britoia

Anon'r this time it happened, (as is found in the Roman

to the senate ; for feer we should violate the ancient nobility
of our father Priamus, by shedding the blood of our kins-

men.” All which he accordingly took care to signify iu

We cannot but wonder, Caesar, at the avarice of the Roman
people, since their insatiable thirst for money cannot let us
alone, though the dangers of the ocean have placed us ina
manner out of the world ς but they must have the presump-
