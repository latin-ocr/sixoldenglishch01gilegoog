Tun king, therefore, being put into his vehicla they marched
directly to Verulam, where the Saxons were grievously·
oppressing the people. When Octa and Eosa had intelligence
that the Britons were come, and that the king was brought
in a horse-litter, they disdained to fight with him, saying, it
would he a shame for such brave men to fight with one that
was half dead. For which reason they retired into the city,
and, as it were in contempt 01 any danger from the enemy,

divided their men into several bodies, and advancing towards
them, began the sttack first, their part being to assault while
the others were only upon the defensive. How'ever, much
blood was shed on both sides, and the greatest part 01 the
day spent in the fight, when at last, Octa and Eosa being
killed. the Saxona turned their backs. and left the Britonss
