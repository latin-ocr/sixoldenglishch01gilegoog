Another monastery, also, was built by the same king as a
residence 1011110, near the eastern gata 01 8110110οΒ1111 and
his own daughter, Ethelgiva, was placed in it as abbess.

Tllesll trlllngs being thus disposed 01, the king began, as
was his practice, 10 consider within himself, what more he
could do to augment and show forth his piety; what he had
