vices were again wanted. The third company also gave place
to the first in the same way, and also spent two months at
home. Thus was the threefold division of the companies ar·
ranged at all times in the royal household.

To these therefore was paid the first of the three portione
aforesaid, to each according to their respective dignities and
peculiar services ; the second to the operativae, whom he had
collected from every nation, and had about him in large num·
bers, men skilled in every kind of construction3 the third
portion was assigned to foreigners who carne to him out of
every nation far and near, whether they asked money of him
or not, he cheerfully gave to each with wonderful munificence
according to their respective merits, according to what is
written: “ God loveth a cheerful giver.'’

But the second part of all his revenues, which came yearly
into his possession, and was included in the receipts of the
exchequer, as we mentioned a little before, he, with ready de·

nothing, nor nothing to whom something.'' The second of
the four portions was given to the two monasterias which he
had built, and to those who therein had dedicated themselves
to God's service, as we have mentioned above. The third
portion was assigned to the school, which hc had studiously
collected together, consisting of many of the nobility of his
own nation. Tho fourth portion was for the use of all
the neighbouring monasterias in all Saxony and Marcia, ond
also during some years, in turn, to the churches and servants
of God dwelling in Britain [Wales]‚ Comwall, Gaul, Ar-
morica, Northumbria, and sometimes also in Ireland; accord·
ing to his means, he either distributed to them beforehand, or
afterwards, if life and success should not fail him.

When the king had arranged these matters, he remem-
