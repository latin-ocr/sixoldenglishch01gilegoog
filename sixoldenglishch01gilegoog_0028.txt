in the Royal Marino Academy at copenhagen, who trans·
mitted to the celebrated antiquary‚ Doctor Stukeley‚ a tran·
script of the whole in letters, together witha copy of the
map. From this transcript Stukeley published an analysis
of the work, with the Itinerary, first in a thin quarto, in
1757, and afterwards in the second volume of his Itinera·

published by Professor Bertram at copenhagen, in asmall

tram thus speaks in his pressos: “The work of Richard
of Cir-encester, which came into my possession in an extra-
ordinary manner with many other curiosities, is not entirely
complete, yet its author is not to be classed with the most
inconsiderable historiens of the middle age. It contains
many fragments of abetter time, whichfwould now in vain
be sought for elsewhere ; and all are useful to the antiqusry

have inspected it, es a jewel, and worthy to be rescued
l’rom destruction by the prese. From respect for him Ι have
caused it to be printed?

'of the map Bertram observest “I have added a very
antient map of Roman Britain, skilfully drawn according to
the accounts os tho ancients, which in rarity and antiquity
exoels the rest of the Commentary of Richard.”

This map, however, as no longer os use in an sgewhen
