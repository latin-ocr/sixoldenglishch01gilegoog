And the aforesaid army of the pagana, galloping back to
N orthumberland, went to York, and there passed the winter.

ln the year of our Lord‘s incarnation 870, which was the
twenty-second of king Alfred’s life, the above-named army
ol pagens, passed through Mercia into EastAnglia, and
wintered at Thetford.

In the same year Edmund, king oi the EastAngles, fought
most fiercely against them; but, lamentable to say, the
pagano triumphed, Edmund was slain in the battle, and the
enemy reduced all that country to subjectior.

In the same year Ceolnoth, archbishop oi Oanterbury, went
the way of all flesh, and was buried peaceably in his own
city.

In the year oi our Lord's incarnation 871, which was the
twenty-third of king Alfred's life, the pagan army, of hate·
tul memory‚ left the East-Angles‚ and entering the kingdom
of the WestSaxons, cameto the royal city, called Reading,
situated on the south bank of the Thames, in the district
called Berkshire; and there, on the third day after their ar·
thal, their earls, with great part oi the army, scoured the
co‘untry for plunder, while the others made a rampart between
the rivers Thames and Kennet on the right side of the same
royal city. They were eucountered by Ethelwulf‚ earl oi
Berkshire, with his men, at a place called Englefield 3* both
sides fought bravely, and made long resistance. At length
one oi the pagan earls was slain, and the greater part of the
army destroyed3 upon which the rest saved themselves
by flight, and the Christiane gained the victory.

Four days afterwards, Ethelred, king of the West-Saxons‚
and his brother Alfred, united their forces and marched to

¹ Reading, where, on their arrival, they cut to pieces the pagens
. whom they found outside the fortifications. But the pagane,
nevertheless, sallied out from the gates, and a long and
heroo engagement ensued. At last, grief to say, the Chris-tiens
fied, the pagana obtained the victory, and the aforesaid carl
Ethelwuli was among the alain.

Roused by this calamity, the Christiana, in chame and in-

, dignation‚ within four days, assembled all their forces, and

again eucountered the pagan army at a place called Ashdune,†
which means the ‘⁶ Hill of the Ash.'’ The pagana had divided
