friendship of the king. For those who desired to augment
their worldly power, obtained power; those who desired
money, gained money; and in like way, those who desired
his friendship‚ or both money and friendship, succeeded in
getting what they wanted. But all of thern gained his love
and guardianship and defeuce from every quarter, even as the
king with his men could protect himself.

When therefore I had come into his presence at the royal
vill, called Leonaford‚ Ι was honourably received by him, and
remained that time with him athis court eight months; during
which 1 read to him whatever books he liked, and such as he
had at hand; for thiais his most usual custom, both night
and day, amid his many other occupatione of mind and body,
either himself to read books, or to listen whilst others read
them. And when Ι frequently asked his leave to depart,
and could in no way obtain it, at length when Ι had made
up my mind by all means to demand it, he called me to
him at twilight, on Christmas eve, and gave me two letters,
in which was a long list of all the things which were in
two monasteriae, called in Saron, Ambresbury* aad Banwell;†
and on that same day he delivered to me those two mo·
naateries with all the things that were in them, and asilken
pall of great value, and a load for a strong man, of incense,
adding these words, that he did not give me these triffing
presents, because he was unwilling hereafter to give me
greater; for in the course of time he unexpectedly gave me
Exeter, with all the diocese which belonged to him in Saxonyss
and in Cornwall, besides gifts every day, without number, in
every kind of worldly wealth, which it would be too long tc
enumerate heia, lest they should make my reader tired.
But let rto one suppose that I have mentioned these pre·
senta in this place for the sake of glory or flattery, or to
obtain greater honour. Icall God to witness, that I have
not done so; but that Ι might certify to those who are igno·
rant, how profuse he is in giving. He then at once gave
me permission to ride to those two rich monasterias and
afterwards to return to my own country.

ln the year of cur Lord’s incarnation, 886, which was the
thirty-eighth since the birth of Alfred, the army so often
beforementioned again fied the country, and went into the
