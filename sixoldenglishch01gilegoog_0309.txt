’ “Iris a grief tous, noble youths, that the country ol your
ancestors is oppressed bya barbarous nation, and that you
are ignominiously driven cut of it. But since other men are
ableto defend their kingdoms, it is a wonder your people
should lose so fruitsul an island, and not be ableto with·

driven out with disgrace. But after the Britons came into
this province under the conduct of Maximian and Conan,
those that remained never had the happiness afterwards ol
holding an uninterrupted possession cf the crown. For
though many of their princes maintained the ancientdignity
of their ancestorS, yet their weak heirs that succeeded,
though more in number, entirely lost it, upon the invasion
of their enemiea Therefore 1 am grieved for the weakness
of your people, since we are of the same race with you, and
the name of Britons is common to you, and to the nation that
bravely defends their country, which you see at war with all

my kingdom. But what you say is awonder, that my peoplc
have not maintained the dignity of their ancestors, since the
