and so to deprive them insidiously of their life or power;
andif she could not obtain the king's consent, she used to
take them off by poison: as is ascertained to have been the
case with a certain young man beloved by the king, whom she
poisoned, finding that the king would not listen to any accu-
sation against him. Itis said, moreover, that king Bertric
rmwittingly tasted of the poison, though the queen intended
ιο gived it ιο the young man only, and so both of them
erishe .

p Bertrie therefore being dead, the queen could remain no
longer among the WestSaxons, but sailed beyond the sea
with immense treasures, and went to the court of the great
and famous Charlea king of the Franks. As she stood
before the throne, and offered him money, Charles said to
her, ‘⁶ (lhoose, Eadburga, between me aud myron, who stands
here with me.” She replied, foolishly, and without deliber-
ation, “If I am ιο have my choice, 1 choose your son, be-
cause he is younger than you.'' At which Charles smiled
md answered‚ ‘⁶ If you had chosen me, you would have
had my son; but as you hare chosen him, you shall not
have either of us.”

However, he gave her a large convent of nuns, in which,
having laid aside the secular habit and taken the religious
dress, she discharged the office of abbess during a few years ;
for, ar she is said ιο have lived irrationally in her own country,
s'o she appears ιο have acted still more so in thet foreign
country; for being convicted of having had unlawful inter·
course with a man of ber own nation, she was expelled from

*the monastery by king Charles's order, and lived a vicious, life
of reproach in povertyand misery until her death3 so that
at last, accompauied by one slave only, as we have heard
from many who saw her, she begged her bread daily at Paria,
and ro miserably died,

Now king Ethelwulf lived two years after his return kom
Rome; during which, among many other good deeds of this
present life, reflecting on his departure according ιο the way
of all flesh, that his sons might not quarrel unreasonably
atter their father's death, hs ordered a will or letter of ire
