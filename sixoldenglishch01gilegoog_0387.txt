the pastors who guide my people, Ye bave dispersed my
flock, and cast them forth, and not visited them. Behold 1
will visit upon you the malice of your endeavours, saith our
Lord. For the prophet and the priest are both defiled, and
athlethaittttttttttttttttzwt
lor they shall be thrust forward, and fall down together
therein, for l will bring evils upon them, the year of their
visitation, saith our Lord. And in the prophets of Samaria
I have seen lbolishness‚ and they did prophesy in Baal, and

until the time that he worketb, and until he fulfilleth the
cogitation of his heart. In the last days of all shall ye un·

in admonishment of slothful priests, and lamentation os
the people’s suffering for their iniquities‚saying= “ Awake
ye who are drunk, from your wine, and weep and bewail ye
all, who have drunk wine even to drunkenness, because joy

and delight are taken away from your mouths Mourn ys
