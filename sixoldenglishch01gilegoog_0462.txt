No ghosts descend to dwell in dreedful night ι
Νι parting souls to grisly Pluto go,
Nor seek the dreery silent shades below,
But forth they fly immortel in their kind,
And other bodies in new worlds they find;
Thus lile for ever runs its endless rece,
And like ι line desth but divides the space,
A stop which cen but for ι moment lest,
A point between the future and the part
'I'hrice happy they beneeth their northern skies,
Who thet worst seer-the seer of death-despite
Hence they ιιο ceres ιὀι this smil being feel,
But rush undeunted on the pointed steel;
Proroke approaching frte, end bravely scorn
'l'o spere thet lile which must ιο soon return.”
