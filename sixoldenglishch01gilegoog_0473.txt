ι famous city supposed to have been built by Vespasian.
But Glevum,⁹ situated in the extreme part of the kingdom,
towards the territory of the Silures, was occupied bya Ro·
man colony, which, according to the writers of those times,
was introduced by Claudius Caesar. Adjoining to thesewere
the Cassii, whose chief cities were Forum Dianae¹ and Ver·
ulamium.² But when the last was raised by the Romans to
the municipal rank, it obtained the pre-eminence over the
other cities. St Alban the martyr was here born. This
city was involved in the ruin of Camulodunum³ and Londi-
nium,‘ in the insurrection of Bonduica, which is related by
Tacitus. The Cassii were conspicuous above the other
nations of the island3 and Caesar in his second invasion had
the severest conflicts with their renowned chief Cassihelli·
nus, to whom many poople were tributary ; and was repulsed
by the Cassii in league with the Silures; to which Lucan
alludes :—“ Territa quaene ostendit terga Britanno? But
on the coming os Claudius, they, with the neighbouring
people, were subdued, and their country reduced to a Roman
province, first called Caesariensis, and afterwards Flavia.

29. Near the Cassii, where the river Thamesis approaches
the ocean, was the region of the Trinobantes,⁵ who not only
entered into alliance with the Romans, but resigned to them
Londinium their metropolis, and Camalodunnm situated near
the sea, for the purpose of establishing colonies. In this
city was supposed to be born Plavis ,J ulia Helena, the pious
wife of Constantine Chlorus and mot-her of Constantine the
Great, who was descended from the blood of the British
kings. It was the chief colony of the Romans in Britain,
and distinguished by a temple of Claudius, an image of
Victory, with many ornaments.⁶ But Londinium was and
ever will be a city of great eminence. It was first named
Trinovantum, then Londinium, afterwards Augusta, and now
