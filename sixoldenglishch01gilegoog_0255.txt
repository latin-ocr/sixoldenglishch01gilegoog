life, had fied over with them into Germany‚ and occasioned
great faor over the kingdom. For there was a repert of their
great levies in Germany, and the vast fleet which they had -
prepared for their return to destroy the island: which the
event verifled. For they returned in a great ficet, and with
a prodigious number of men, and invaded the parts of
Albania, where they destroyed both cities and inhabitants

were all entered into his presence, he sharply rebuked them
in menacing language, and swore he himself would lead them
against the enemy. For this purpose he ordered a horse·

infirmity would not suffer him to use any other sort of
vehicle; and he charged them to be all ready to march
against the enemy on the first opportunity. Sc, without
