island above mentioned, wherein they had built oities and
castles, bridges and streets of admirable construction, which
are seen among us even to the present day. But whilst the
people of Britain were living carelessly within the wall,
which had been built by Severus toprotect them, there arose
two natione, the Picts in the north and the Seots iu the west,
