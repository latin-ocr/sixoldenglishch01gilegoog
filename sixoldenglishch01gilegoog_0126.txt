had best desire of Pandrasus‚ who, being now in their
power, would readily grant whatever they would request of
him, in order to regain his liberty. They, according to
their different fancies, desired different things; some urged
him to request that a certain part of the kingdom might be
assigned them ibr their habitation3 others that he would
demand leave to depart, and to be supplied with necessarios
ior their voyage. After they had been a long time in

matter which I think so much concerns your safety? The
only thing you can request, with any prospect ofa firm

whatever else shall be necessary for our voyage. If we
obtain this, we may with his leave remove to some other

country.'¹
