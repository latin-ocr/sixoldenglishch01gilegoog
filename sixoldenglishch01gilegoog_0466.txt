was inhabitod by the Cautii, and contains the cities os Dur'o-
brobis⁶ and Cautiopolis,⁷ which was tho metropolia and tha
barini-place of St. Augustis, the apostle of tha English;
Dubrae,⁸ Lemanus,⁹ and Regulbium¹ garrisoned by the
Romanu also their primary station Rhutupis‚⁸ which was
colonized and became the metropolis, and where a haven was
formed capable of containing the Roman lieet which oom-
nranded the North Sea This city was of such celebrity that
ιι gave the name of Rhutupine to the neighbonring shores3
which Lucan,

‘⁴ Aut vaga quum Thetis Rhutnpinaqua littora fervent'

From hence oysters oi a large size and superior flavour m
sent to Rome, as Juvenal observes,
“ Circaeis nata forent, an
Lucrin num ad saxum, Rnnrurruovsedita fpndo
Ostrea, callebat primo deprendere morsu.''
