oomespond: and while he was reflecting upon it as some·
thing that appeared miraculous, Arthur vcame to him, and
told him of another ond in tha same province, which was ,
‚yet more wonderlffissffl'not far from thence was one whose
length and breadth were each twenty feet, and depth five ,
feet But whether its square figure was natural or arti·

licial, the wonder of it was, there were faur different sorte of ,
fishes in the four several cornere of it, none of which were
ever found in any other part of the pond but their own. He
told him likewise of another pond in Wales, near the Severn,
called by the country people Linligwan‚ into which when the
sea flows, it receives it in the manner of egulf, but so as to
swallow up the tide, and never be filled, or have its banks
covered by it. But at the ebbing of the sea, it throws out
the wetere which it had swallowed, as high as a mountain,
and at last dashes and covers the banks with them. In the
meantime, if all the people of that country should stand near Ι
with their faces towards it, and happened to have their clothes
sprinkled with the dashing of the waves, they would hardly, '
if at all, escape being swallowcd up by the pond. But with
their backs towards it, they need not fear being dashcd,
though they stood upon the very banks.

Tan king, after his general pardon granted to the Secta, went ’
to Yorlr to celebrate the feast of Christ's nativity‚ which was
now at hand. On entering the city, he beheld with grief
the desolation of the churches; for upon the expulsion ol
the hely Archbishop Sanxo, and of all the clergy there,
the temples which were half burned down, had no longer
divine service performed in them: so much had the impious
rage of the pagans prevailed. After this, in an assembly of
the clergy and peoplc‚ he appointed Pyramus his chaplain
metropolitan of that see. The churches that lay level with
the ground, he rebuilt, and (which was their chief ornament)
saw them filled with assemblies of devout persons of both
sexes. Also the nobility that were driven out hythe dis·
nubanatis of the Saxons. he restored to their country.
