which was uo small portion of the holy aud venerable erosa
on which our Lord Jesus Christ was suspended, for the
general salvation of mankind.

In tho same year also the army of pagens, which dwelt
among the East Angles, disgracefully broke the peace which
they had concluded with king Altred

Wherefore, to retum to that from which I digressed‚ that
l may not be compelled by my long navigation to abendon
the port of rest which 1 was making for, 1 propoee, usfar as
my knowledge will enable me, to speak of the life and cha-
racter and just conduct of my lord Amen, king of the
Auglo-Saxons. after he married the above named respected
lady of Mercian rece, his wise; and, with God's blessing,I
will despatoh it succinctly and briefly‚ as 1 promised, that 1
may not offend the delicate minds of my readers by prolixity
in relating each new event.

His nuptiale were honourably celebrated in Mercia‚ among
innumerable multitudes of people of both sexes; and after
continual feasts, both by night and by day, he was imme-
diately seized, in presence of all the people, by sudden and
overwhelming pain, as yet unknown to all the physicians;
for it was unknown to all who were then present, and even
to those who daily see him up to the present time-which.
sad to say! is the worst of all, that he should have protracted
it so long from the twentieth to the fortieth year of his lif ,
and even more than that through the space of so many years,-
from what cause so great a malady arose. For many thought
that this was occasioned by the favour and fascination of
the people who surrounded him; others, by some spite of the
devil, who is ever jealous of the good3 others, from an un-
usual kind of fever. He had this sort of severe disease from
his ohildhood; but once, divine Prouidence so ordered it,
that when he was on a visit to Oomwall for the sake of

J hunting‚ and had turned out of the road to pray in a certain

chapel, in which rests the body of Saint Guerir,* and now
also St. Neot† rests there‚-for king Alfred was always frum
his infancy a frequent visitor of holy places for the sake of
prayer and almsgiwing‚-he prostrated himself for private
devotion, and, after some time spent theram, he entreated of

θ St. Guerir’s church was at Ham Stoke, iu Cornwall.
† An interestmg account of St. Neot wiri be found in Gorham's llismry
aud Antiquities of Eynesbury and St. Neot'r.
