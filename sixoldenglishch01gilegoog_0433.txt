Ahar a short interval Vortimer died3 before his decens,
anxious for the future prosperity of his country, he charged

. lus friends to inter his body at the entrance of the Saxon

port, viz. upon the rock where the Saxons first landed ; “ for
though,” said he, “they may inhabit other parts of Britain,
yet if you follow my commende, they will never remain in
this island.'‘ They imprudently disobeyed this last injunc-
tion, and neglected to bury him where he had appointed*

545. After this the barbatiane became finnly incorpo-
rated, and were assisted by foreign pagans3 lor Vortigern
was their friend, on account of the daughter† of Hengist,
whom he so much loved, that no one durst light against him
-in the meantime they soothed the imprudant king, and
whilst practising every appearance of fondnesa'w plotting
with his enemies. And let him that reads unders d, that
the Saxons were victorious, and ruled Britain, not from
their superior prowess, but on account ol' the great sius ol'
the Britons: God so permitting it

. For what wisc man will resist the wholesome counsel ol ’

God? The Almighty is the King of hings, and the Iord of

lcpds, rnling and judging every one, according to his own
easure. ,

p After the death of Vortimer‚ Hengist being strengthsned
oy new accessione, collected his ships, and calling his leaders
together, consulted by what stratagem they might overcome
Vortigern and his army3 with insidious intention they sent
messengers to the king, with offers of peace and perpetual
friendship3 unsuspicious of treachery, the monasth, after
advising with his olders, accepted the proposals.

d 46. Hengist, under pretence of ratifying the treaty‚ pre·
pared an entertainment, to which he iuvited the king, the
nobles, and military officers, in number about three hundred3
speciously concealing his wicked intention, he ordered three
hundred Saxone to conceal esch a knife uuderhis feet, and
to mix with the Britons; “ and when,” said he, “they aro
sufficieutly inebriated, &a cry out, ‘Nimed eure Saxes,' then
leteschdraw his hnife, andkillhis man ς butsparothe king,

‘a Rapio says he was buried at Linooln ς Geoffrey, at London, see p. los.
