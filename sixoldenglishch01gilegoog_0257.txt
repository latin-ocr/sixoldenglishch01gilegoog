complete victory. The king at this was in such an ecstasy
of joy, that whereas before he could hardly raise up himseli
without the help of others, he now without any difficulty sat
upright in his horse-litter of himself, as if he was on a sudden
restored tn health ; and said with a laughing and merry
countenanoe “These Ambrons called me the half-dead king,
because my sinkness obliged me to licon a horse-litter; and
indeed so 1 was. Yet victory to me half dead, is better thau
to be safe and sound and vanquished. For to die with
honours 1s preferable to living with disgrace”

Tus Saxona, notwithstanding this defeat, persisted still m
their maline, and entering the northern provinces, without
respite infested the penple there. Uther's purpose was to
have pursued them ; but his princes dissuaded him from it.

resolved to take him off by poison ; in which they succeeded.
For while he was lying ill at Verulam, they sent away some
spies in a poor habit, to learn the state of the court3 and
when they· had thoroughly informed themselves of tho
posture of affairs, they found out an expedient by which
they might best accomplish their villainy. For there was
near the court a spring of very clear water, which the king
used to drink of, when his distemper had made all other
liquors nauseous to him. This the detestable conspiratnrs
made use of to destroy him, by so poisoning the whole mass
of water which sprang up, that the next time the king drank
of it, he was siezed with sudden death as were also a hundred
other persons after him, till the villainy was discovered, anda
hcap of earth thrnwn over the well. As soon as the king's
death was divulged‚ the bishops and clergy of the kingdom
assembled, and carried his body to the convent nl Ambrins,
where they buried' rt with regal solemnity, close by Aurelius
Ambrosius, within the Giant's Dance
