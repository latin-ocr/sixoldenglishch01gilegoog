Η1110101, with his Saxona, was struck with terror atthis
news, 101 110 dreadcd the valour 01 Aurelius. Such was the
bravery and contage this prince was 100010101, that while
Δ110 was in Gaul, there was none 11101 durst encounter with
him. For in 011 0000001010 he either dismounted his adver·
sary, or hrolre his spear. Besides, he was magnificent in his
presente, constant athis devotions, temperate in all respecta, ’
and above all things hated a lie. Α brave soldier on 1001, 0
better 011 horsebaclr, and expert in the discipline 01 an army.
Reports 01 these his noble accomplishments, while 110 yet
continued in Armorican Britain, were daily brought over into
the island. Therefore, the Saxona, 101100101 him, retired
beyond the Humber‚ and 10 those parts fortified the 011100
and towns ; for that country always was a place 01 refuge 10
1110101 their safety lying 10 1110 neighbourhood 01 scotland,
which used to watch all opportunities 01 distressing the
nation3 for that country being in itself a frightful place
to live in, and wholly uninhabited, had been 0 0010 retreat
101 strangers. By its situation it lay open 101110 Picta, Scots,
Dacians, Norwegians, and others, that came 10 plunder the
island. Being, therefore, secure 01 0 0010 reception in this,
country, they fled towards it, 11101, if there should be 0000-
0100, they might retreat into it as 1010 their own camp. This
was good news to Aurelius, and made him conceive greater
hopes 01 victory. So assembling his people quickly together,
he augmented his army, and made 00 expeditious march
towards the north. In his passage through the countries,
he was grieved 10 000 the desolation made 10 them, but
especially that the churches were levelled with the ground;
and he promised to rebuild thern, 11 he gained the victory.

Bur Hengist, upon his approach, took contage again, and
chose 001 1110 bravest 01 11101000, whom he exhorted to make
agallant del'ence‚ and not be dauuted 01 Aurelius, who, he
told them, had but few Armorican Britons with him, since
their· number did 001 exceed ten thousand. And us 10·
