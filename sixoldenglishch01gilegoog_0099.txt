country oi the Saxone, who live on the right hand, which in
Saxonis called Sussex, under the guidance oi some of that
nation3 and there I first saw him in the royal vill, which is
called Deua* He received ma with kindness‚ and among
other familiar conversation, he asked me eagerly to devote
myself to his service and become his friend, to leave every
thing which 1 possessed on the lest, or western banlr of the
Seram, and he promised he would give more than an equi-
valent ior it in his own dominions. 1 replied that 1 could
not incautiously and rashly promise such things3 for it
seemed to me unjmt, that 1 should leave those sacred
places iu which I had been bred, educated‚ and crowned,†
and at last ordained, ior the sake oi any earthly honour and
power, unless by compulsion. Upon this, he said, “li you
cannot accede to this, at least, let me have your service in
part: spend six months oi the year with me here, and the
other six in Britain.'' To this, hepher, “ 1 could not even
promise that easily or hastily without the advice oi my
friends.” At length, however, when 1 perceived that he was
anxious for my services, though 1 knew not why, I promised
himmerit my life was spared‚ Ι would return to him aiter
six months, with such a reply as should be agreeable to him
as well as advantageous to me and mine. With this answer
he was satisfied, and when Ihad giren him a pledge to retum
attha appointed time, on the fourth day we left him and
returned on horseback towards our own country.

After our departure, a violent sever seized me in the city
oi winchester, where Ι lay lor twelve months and one wael,
night and day, without hope oi recovery. At the appointed
time, therefore, I could not fulfil my promise of visiting him,
and he sent messengers to hasten my Journey, and to inquire
the cause of my delay. Aa Iwas unable to ride to him, ΙΙ
sent a second messenger to tell him the cause of my delay,
and assure him that,if 1 recovered from my infirmity,I
would fulfil what Ι had promised. My complaint lest me,
rnd by the advice and consent os all my friends, for the
benefit of that holy place, and of all who dwelt therein,
