above the rest, and informed of the torturas prepared for
him unless he would do what was commanded him, he made
them this answer :-

“ Since my ill fate has delivered me and my brother Anti·
gonus into your hands, l can do no other than grant you

all other considerations; therefore, wonder not that 1 am
willing to redeam it at so great a price. But though it is
against my inclination that 1 obey your commands, yet it
seems matter of comfort to me that I am to give my daugh-
ter to so noble a youth, whose descent from the illustrious
race of Priamus and Anchises is clear, both from that great·
ness of mind which appears in him, aad the certain accounts
we have had of it. For who less than he could have re-
leased from their chains the banished Trojans, when reduced
under slavery to so many great· princes? Who else could
have encouraged them to make head against the Greeks? or
with so small a body of men vanquished so numerous and
powerful an army, and taken their king prisoner in the
engagement? And, therefore, since this noble youth has
gained so much glory by the opposition which he has made
to me, 1 give him my daughter Ignoge, and also gold, silver,
ships, corn, wine, and oil, and whatever you shall find neces·
sary for your voyage. If you shall alter your resolution,
and think fit to continue among the Greeks, I will grant you
the third part of my kingdom for your habitation; if not,
Iwill faithfully perform my promise, and for your greater
security will stay as a hostage among you till I have made
it ood.’'

{coordingly he held a eouncil, and directed messengers to
all the shores of Graece, to get ships together ; which done,
he delivered them to the Trojans, to the number of three
hundred and twenty-four, laden with all kinds of provision.
and married his daughter to Brutus. He made also a pre·
sent of gold and silver to each man according to his quality.
When everything was performed the king was ser at liberty,
and the Trojans, now released from his power, set sail with
a fair wind But Ignoge, standing upon the stem of the
ship, swooned away several times in Brutus’s arms, and with
many sighs and tcars lamented the leaving her parents md
