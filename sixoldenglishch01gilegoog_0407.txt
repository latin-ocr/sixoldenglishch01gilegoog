same day (wherein ye should with far more right and reason
have been drawn to prison or punishment, than preferred
ωηο priesthood) when our Lord demanded whom his disciplet
supposed him to be, how Peter answered, “ Thou art Christ,
the Son of the living God;” and our Lord in respect of such
his confession, ,said ωηο himz “Blessed art thou, Simon
Bar-jonas, because flesh and blood hath not revealed it ωηο
thee, but my Father whois in heaven.” Peter therefore,
instructed by God the Fathcr, did rightly confess Christ3
but ye being taught by the devil your father, do, with your
lewd actions, wickedly deny our Saviour. It is said to the
true priest, “ Th0u art Peter, and upon this rock will I build
my church :'' but ye resembled “the foolish man, who hath
builded his house upon the sand.” And verily it is to be
noted, that God joineth not in the workmanship with the
unwisc, when they build their house upon the deceitful

depart from me all ye workers of iniquity,” that being
separated with the goats of the left hand, ye may together
with them go into eternal fire. Itis also promised ωηο
every good priest, “Whatsoever thou shalt loose upon earth,
shall bc likewise loosed in heaven: and whatsoever thou shalt
bind upon carth, shall be in like sort bound in heaven.” But
how shall ye loose any thing, that it may be loosed also in
heaven, since yourselves for your sins are severed from
heaven, and hampered in the banda of your own heinous
offences, as Solomon saith, “With the cords of his sins,
every one is tied ?” And with what reason shall ys bind
any thing on this earth, that above this world may be like·
wise bound, unless it be your only solves, who, entanglad in

your iniquities, are so detained on this earth, that ye cannot
