Uror the approach of the feast of Pentecost Arthur, tha
better to demonstrate his joy· aster such triumphant sucoess,
and for the more solemn observation of that festival, and
reconciling the minds of the princes that were now subject
to him, resolved, during that season, to hold a magnificent
court, to plate the crown upon his head, and to invite all the
kings and dukss under his subjectiom to the solemnityss And
when he had communicated his design toliis familiar friends,

its situation, which was in Glamorganshire upon the river

beyond the seas might have the convenience of sailing up to
it. On the other side, the beauty of the meadows and groves,
and magnificentur of the royel palaoes with losty gilded rooe
that adorned it, made it even rival the grandeur of Rome.
It was also famous lor two chorches; whereof one was built
in honour of the martyr Julius, and adorned with a choir
of virgins, who had devoted themselves wholly to the service
of God; but the other, which was founded in memory of St.

learned in astronomy and the other arts, were diligent in
observing the courses os the stars‚ and gave Arthur true
predictions of the events that would huppen at that time.
In this place, therefore, which afforded such delighta were
preparatione made for the ensuing festival. Ambassadors
were then sent into several kingdom, to invite to court the
princes both os Gaul and all the adjacent islands. Ao·
cordingly there came Augusel‚ king of Albania, now

Scotland; Urian‚ king of Mureif ; Cadwallo Lowirh, king
of the Venedotiaus‚ now called the North Wales mene
