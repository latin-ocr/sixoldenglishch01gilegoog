according to Mela famous for the oracle os the Gallio deity,

they raise the winda and the scas with incantatione, change
themselves into what animala they please, and cure disorders
which in other places yield to no remedy; that they have the
knowledge of future events, and prophesy. They are not
savourable except to mariners, and only to such as go thither
for the purpose of consulting them.

Thte first book of the geographieal Commentary on the
