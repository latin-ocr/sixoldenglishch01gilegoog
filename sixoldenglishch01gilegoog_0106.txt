¹though placed in the royal seat3 for from the twentieth year
of his age to the present year, which is his fortieth,* he has
been constantly afflicted with most severe attacks of an un-
known complaint, so that he has not a moment’s ease either
from suffering the pain which it causes, or from the gloom
which is thrown over him by the apprehensiones its coming.
Moreover, the constant invasione of foreign natione, by which
he was continually harassed by land and sea, without any
interval of quiet, were a just cause of disquiet. What
shall I say cf his repeated expeditions against the pagens,
his vars, and incessant occupatione of government? 0f the
daily embaasies sent to him by foreign nations, from the
Tyrrhenian sea to the farthest end of Ireland?† For we

cr hesitate‚ though sailing amid the manifold waves and
eddies of this present life.

For all his bishops, earls, nobles, favourite ministers, and
prefects, who, next to God and the king, had the whole go·
verument of the kingdom, as is fitting, continually received
from him instruction, respect, exhortation, and command,
hay, at last, when they were disobedient, and bis long patience
was exhausted, he would reprove thern severely, and censure
at pleasure their vulgar folly and obstinacy; and in this way
he directed their attention to the common interests of the
kingdom. But, owing to the sluggishness of the people,
