¹'from Britain, on account of its having been formerly under

the yoke of Julius Caesar, audather Roman emperors3 1 for
the same reason now decree, that Rome ought tc pay tribute
to me, because my predecessore formerly held the govern-
ment of it. For Belinus, that glorious king of the Britons,
with the assistance of his brother Brennus, dnke of the
Allobroges, after they had hauged up twenty noble Romans
in the middle of the marhot-place, took their city, and kept

with glorians success; since it will be undertaken for the de·
fence of our liberties, and to demand justly of our enemies,
what they have unjustly demanded of us. For that person who
would rob another, deserves to lose his own by him against
whom the attempt is made. And, therefore, since the Romans
threatened us with this injury, it will undoubtedly turn to
their own loss, if we cau have but an opportunity of engag-
ing with them. This is what the Britons universally desire:
this is what we have promised usin the Sibyllino prophecies,
which expressly declara, that the Roman empire shall be
