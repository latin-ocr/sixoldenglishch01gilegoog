'lhir Immffi.tg.eittr}c{1⁰f the BXnthErhfyrdStreet, from Pereneey
and Eert Boume, which were perhaps the Aaderrda Portae end Anderida

os the loth Iter, along the ridge of hille to Holwood Hill (already ,

mentioned aethe capital of the Rhemi), and from thence to London, bnt
ite traces are now eo obscure as to be almost forgotten. Some think that
from ¹london it proceeded along the Britieh Street, by the Green Lanee,
Cheehunt and to the west of Broxbourne to Ware3 while othere rnppoee-
that thie Romen road went much straighter, and nearly ia the couree of
the present tumpike through Were to Broughing‚ apost et the confluence
ot' the Rib and the Quin, where wae probably the etation Aa diaes, the
bonnm between the countriee of the Iceni, the Caedi, and the 'frino-
bantee. From hence the Roman rond iero perfect by Caxton quite to
Lincoln, that we fix the station of Dammaear at the great camp near
Castor, end the three othere at Godmancheeter, eumer, and Lincoln.
From Lincoln the Roman read proceededirectly tothebanke os the Homber,
haring, at the distance aerigned in the Iter, the Mansio in Medio, end tha
portet Winterton; from whenceeixmileeoarry uoacrorethe riverto Brorrgh,
or Petuaria, a post osten conlounded with the Pretorium of the oth lter.
Ae there ie a Roman rond still exieting irem Brongh toward· Weighton,

end then orer Barmhy Moor tc York, there oen be little doubt in Ι

considering it ae the course of thie lter. Shonld, however, the sorry-rix
mileo given in the itinerary (which appears to hare been en error “’
t'rom the mietoke oi the hantenber in eonfoonding Petuaria an
Pretorium) be considered ee correct, the courre of the lter may be
errppoeed to heve run from Brough by Iendeebomugh and Millington, ta
the great roed from Flamborongh, and then to have turned with itto York‚
making exactly the fortyeix mileo ol the Itinerory.
