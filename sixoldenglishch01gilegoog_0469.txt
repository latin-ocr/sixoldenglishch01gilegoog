Wales its modern name, or whether their origin is more
remote. Their chief cities were Termolus⁸ and Artavia.⁹
From hence, according to the ancienta, are seen the pillars of
Hercules, and the island Herculea¹ not far distant. From
the Uxella a chain of mountains called Ocrinum extends to
the promontory known by the same name.

17. Beyond the cimbri the Carnabii inhahited the
extreme angle of the island,2 from whom this district pro·
bably obtmned its present name of Carnubia (Comwall).
Their chief cities were Musidumiand Halangium.⁴ But as
the Romans nevar frequented these almost desert and
uncultivated parts of Britain, their cities seem to have been
¹ of little consequence, and were therefore neglected by·
historians; though geographers mention the promontories
Bolerium and Antivestaeum.⁵

18. Near the above-mentioned people on the sea-coast
towards the south, and bordering on the Belgae Allobroges,
lived the Dumnonii, the most powerful people of those partu
on which account Ptolemy assigns to them all the country
extending into the sea like an arm.⁶ Their cities were
Uxellal Tamara,8 Voluba⁹ Cenia,¹ and Isca,2 the mother of
all, situated upon the Isca. Their chief rivers were the Ιεοει,3
Durius,⁴ Tamarus,⁵ and Oenius.⁶ A Their coasts are dis-
tinguished by three promontories, which will be hereaster
mentioned. This region was much frequented hythe Phoe·
nician, Grecian, and Gallie merchants, for the metals with
which it abounded, particularly for its tin. Proofs of this
may be drawn from the names of the above-mentioned

are also denominated OEstromenides and Cassiterides.
