Saxeus, upon the signal given, drew their daggers, aud fell·
lug upon the princes, who little suspected any such design,

assassinated them to the number of four hundred and sixty
barone and consuls3 to whose bodies St. Eldad afterwards
gave Christian burial, not far from Kaercaradauc, now Salis·
bury, in a burying·place near the monastery of Ambrius, the
abbat, who was the founder of it. For they all came without
arms, having no thoughts of anything but treating of peaoe3
which gave the others a fairer opportunity of exercising their
villainous design against them. But the pagaus did not
escape unpunished while they acted this wickedness; a great
number of them being killed during this massacre of their
enemies. For the Britons, taking up clubs and stenes from
the ground, resolutely defended themselves, and did good
execution upon the traitors.

lenna was present one Eldol, consul* of Gloucester, who,
at the sight of this treachery, took up a stake which he hap·
pened to find, and with that made his defense. Every blow
he gave carried death along with it ; and by breaking
either the head, arms, shoulders, or legs of a great many, he
struck no small terror into the traitors, nor did he move from
the spot before he had killed with that weapon seventy meu.
But being no longer able to stand his ground against such
numbers, he made his escape from them, and retired to his ⁸
own city. Many fell on both sides, but the Saxone got the

victory; because the Britons, having no suspicion of treachery,
came unarmed, and therefore made a weaker defense. After
the commissiou of this detestable villany, the Saxona would
not kill Vortigern; but having threatened him with death
and bouud him, demanded his eities and fortified places in
considerationes their granting him his life. He, to secure
himself, denied them nothing 3 and when they had made him
confirm his grants with an esth, they released him from his
chains, and then marched first to London‚ which they took,
ss they did afterwards York, Lincoln, and winchester,
