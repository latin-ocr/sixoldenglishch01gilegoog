lor many previous years the love of a monastic life lau utterly
decayed from that nation as well as hom many other natione,
though many monasterias still remain in that country; yet, as
no one directed the rule of that kind of life in aregular way,
ior what reason I cannot say, either from the invasione ol
foreigners which· took place so frequently both by sea and
land, or because that people abounded in riches of every
kind, and' so looked with contempt on the monastic life. lt
was for this reason that king Alfred sought to gather monks
of different kinds to place in the same monastery.

First he placed there as abbat, J obn* the priest and monk,
an old Saron by birth, then certain priests and deacons from
beyond the sea3 ol whom, finding that he had not as large a
number as he wished, he procured as many as possible of the
same Gallio racc, some of whom, being children, he ordered
to be taught in the same monastery, and at a later period to
be admitted to the monastic habit. Ihave myself seen a
young lad of pagan birth who was educated in that monastery,
and by no means the hindmost of them all.

There was also a deed done once in that monastery, which
Iwould utterly oonsign to oblivion, although it is an un·
worthy deed; ior throughout the whole of Scriptura the base
deeds of the wicked are interspersed among the blessed deeds
oi the just, as tares and darnel are sown among the wheatt
good deeds are recorded that they may be praised and irni-
tated, and that their imitators may be held in all honour3
ciolred deeds are there related, that they may be censured
and avoided, and their imitators be reproved with all odium,
contempt, and vangeance.

For once upon a time, a certain priest and a deacon, Gauls

tion of the devil, and excited by some secret jealousy,

came so embittered in secret against their abbat, the above
mentioned John, that, like Jews, they circumvented and be-
trayed their master. For whereas hc had two servants, whom
he had hired out of Gaul, they taught these such wicked
practices, that in the night. when all men wore enjoying the
aveat tranquillity of sleep, they should make their way imo
