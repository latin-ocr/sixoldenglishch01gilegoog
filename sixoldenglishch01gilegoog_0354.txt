in the months of your prophets may seduce you, heerken

suffered the spirit of lying to possess the mouths of all thy
prophete that do here remain, and our Lord hath pronounoed
evil against thee.” For even now it is certain that there ars
some teachers inspired with a contrary spirit, preaching and
affirming rather what is pleasing, however depraved, than
what is true: whose words are eofter than oil, and the same
