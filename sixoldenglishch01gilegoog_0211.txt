ΙΝ the meantime there arrived in Kent three brigandines, <r
long galleys, full of armed men, under the command of two
brothers, Horsa and Hengist.* Vortigern was then at
Dorobernia, now Canterbury, which cityfhe used often to
visit3 and being informed of the arrival of some tall
strangers in large ships, he ordered that they should be
received peaceably, and conducted into his presence. As
soon as they were brought before him, he cast his eyes upon
the two brothers, who excelled all the rest both in nobility
and gracefulness of person ; and having taken a view of the
vvhole company, asked them of what country they were, and
vvhat was the occasion of their coming into his kingdom.
To whom Hengist (whose years and wisdom entitled him to
a precedence)‚ in the name of the rest, made the following
answer:-

“Most noble king, Saxony, which is one of the countries
of Germany, was the place of our birth3 and the occasion
of our coming was to offer our service to you or some other
prince. For we were driven out of our native country, for
noother reason, but that the laws of the kingdom required
it. It is customary among us, that when we come to be
overstocked' with people, our princes from all the provinces
meet together, and command all the youths of the kingdom
to assemble before them ; then casting lots, they make choice
of the strongest and ablest of them, to go into foreign nations,
to procure themselves a subsistence, and free their native
country from a superfluous multitude of people. Our
country, therefore, being of late overstocked, our princes
met, and after having cast lots, made choice of the youth
which you see in your presence, and have obliged us to obey
