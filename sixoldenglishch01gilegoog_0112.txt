gan to reflect what he could offer to God from the service of
his body and mind; for he proposed to consecrate to God no
less out of this than he had done cf things external to hirn-
self. Moreover, he promised, as far as his infirmity and his
means would allow, to give up ιο God the hali of his ser.
vices, bodily and mental, by night and by day, voluntarily,
and with all his might; but, inasmuch as he could not
equally distinguish the lengths of the hours by night, on ac-
count of the darkness, and ofttimes of the day, on account of
the storms and clouds, he began ιο consider, by what means
and without any difficulty, relying cn the mercy of God, he
might discharge the promised tenor of his vow until his
death. ,
Alter long reflection on these things, he at length, by a
useful and shrewd invention, commanded his chaplains ιο
supply wax iu a sufficient quantity, and he caused it ιο ιο

weighed in such a manner that when there was so much of ··

it in the scales, as would equal the weight of seveuty-two
penca* he caused the chaplains to make six candles thereof,
each of equal length, so that each eandle might have twelve
divisions† marked longitudinnlly upon it. By this plan,
therefore, those six candles burned for twenty-four hours, a
night and day, without fail, before the sacred relies of many
of God’s elect, which always accompanied him whererer he
went; but sometimes when they would not continue buming
a whole day and night, till the same hour that they were
lighted the preceding evening, from the violence of the wind,
which blew day and night without intermission through the
doors and windows of the chureh‘es, the fissures of the divi-
siom, the planhings, or the wall, or the thin canvass of tha
tents, they then unavoidably burned out and finished their
course before the appointed time; the king therefore consi·
dered by what means he might shut out the wind, and so by
auseful and cunning invention, he ordered a lantern ιο be
beautifully constructed of wood and white oxhorn, which,
when slrilfully planed till it is thin, is no less transparent
than a vessel of glass. This lantem, therefore, was wonder·
fully made of wood and horn, as we before said, and by
night a candle was put into it, which shone as brightly with-
cut as within, and was not extinguished by the wind; for th·
