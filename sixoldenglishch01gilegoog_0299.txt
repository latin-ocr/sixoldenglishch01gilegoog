Upon Constantine’s advancement to the throne, the Saxona,
with the two sous of Modred, made insurrection against him,
though without success3 for after many battles they fled,
one to London, the other to Winohester, and possessed them·
selvas of those places. Then died Saint Daniel, the pious
prelate of the church of Bangor; and Theon, bishop of
Gloucester‚ was elected arehbbhop of London. At the
same time also died David, the pious archhishop of Legions.
at the city of Menevia, in his own abbey; which he loved
above all the other monasteries of his diocese, because Saint
Patrick, who had prophetically foretold his birth, was the
founder of it. For during his resideuce there among his
friars, he was taken with a sudden illness, of which he
died, and, at the command of Malgo‚ king of the chedo·
tians, was buried in that church. He was succeeded in
the metropolitan see by Cynoc, bishop of the church of
olan-Palem, who was thus promoted to a higher dignity.

with that of Gildas ε the reader may perhaps from this point delect soma
