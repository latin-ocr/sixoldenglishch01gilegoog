10001 110 forest of Calaterium, which shall fly round the

island for two years together. With her nocturnal cry she
shall call together the winged kind, and assemble to her all
sorts of fowls. They shall invade the tillage of husbandmen,
and devour all the grain of the harvesta. Then shall follow
0 famine upon the people, and a grievous mortality upon the
famine. But when thia calamity shall be over, a detestable
bird shall go 10 110 valley of Galabes, and shall raise it to
be a high mountain. Upon the top thereof it shall also plant
an oak, and build its nest in its branches. Three egge shall
be produced in the nest, from whence shall come forth 0 fon,
awolf‚ 001 0 bear. The fox shall devour her mother, and
bear the head of 00 ass. In this monstrous form shall she
frighten her brothers, and make them fly into Neustria. But
they shall stir up the tusky boar, and returning in a fleet
shall enoounter with the fox; who 01 110 beginning 01 110
flght shall fcign herself dead, and move the boar 10 oom-
passion. Then shall the boar approach her carcass, aud ·
standing over her, shall breathe upon her face and eyes.
But she, 001 forgetting her cunning, shall bite his left 1001,
and pluck 11 off from his body. Theu shall she leap upon
him, and 000101 away his right ear and teil, and hide herself
in the caverns of the mountains. Therefore shall the deluded
boar require the wolf and bear to restore him his members3
who, assoon as they shall enter into the cause, shall promise
two feet of the fex, together with the ear 001 1011, 001 01
these they shall make up the members of 0 hog. With this
he shall be 00110101, 001 expect the promised restitution.
ln the meantime shall the fox descend from the mountains,
and change herself 1010 0 wolf, and under pretence of holding
aconference with the boar, she shall go 10 him, and craftily
devour him. After that she shall transform herself 10100
boar, and feigning 0 loss of some members, shall wait for her
brothers ; but as soon as they are come, she shall suddenly
hill them with her tusks, 001 shall be crowned with the head
of a lion. In her days shall a serpent be brought forth,
which shall be a destroyer 01 mankind With its length it
shall en'oompass London, and devour all that pass by it. The
mountain ox shall take the head of a wolf, and whiten his
10011 10 110 Str-vern. He shall gather 10 him the flocks 01 Alba·
nia 001 (lambris, which shall drinh the river Thames dry.
