adulterers can be partakers ot' the kingdom of heaven,
esteem her detestable sister, who had vowed unto God the
overlasting continency, as the very flower (in the language
of the poet) of the celestial nymphs? Why dost thou

provoke with thy frequent injurias the lamentatione and
sighs of saints, by thy means corporally afflicted, which will
intimato come, like a fierce lioness, break thy bones in
pieces? Desist, Ibeseech thee (as the prophet saith) from
wrath‚ and leave off thy deadly t'ury, which thou breathest
out against heaven and earth, against God and his flock, and
which in time will be thy own torment; rather with altered
mind obtain the prayers of those who possess a power oi
binding over this world, when in this world they bind the
guilty, and of loosing when they loose the peditent· Be not
(as the apostle saith) proudly wisc, nor hope thou in the
uncertainty of tichos, but in God who giveth thee many
things abundantly, and by the amendment of thy manners
purchase unto thyself a good foundation for hereditat, and
seck to enter into that real and true state of existence which
will be not transitory but everlasting. Otherwise, thou
shalt know and see, yea, in this very world, how bad and
bitter a thing it is for thee to leave the Lord thy (lod, and
not have his sear before thino eyes, and in the next, how
thou shalt be burned in the foul encompassing dames of
endless fire, nor yet by any manner of means shalt ever die.
For the souls of the sinful are as eternal in perpetual fire, as
the souls of the just in perpetual joy and gladness.

ξ 33. And likewise, O tho dtr-ag of the island, who
host deprived many tyrants, as wello te1rkingo oi
their lives, and though the last-mentioned in my writing,
the first in mischief, exceeding many in power, and also in
malice, more liberal than others in giving, more licentious in
sinning, strong in arms, but stronger in working thine own
soul's destruction, M locune* why art thou (as if soaked
in the wine of the &damnem grape) foolishly rolling in
that black pool of thine offences? Why dost thou wilfully
heap like a mountain, upon thy kingly shoulders, such a load
of sins? Why dost thou show thyselt'unto the King of kings
(who bath made thee as wellin kingdom asin stature of body
higher than almost all the other chiefs of Britain) not better
