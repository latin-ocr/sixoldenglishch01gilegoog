deed, archbishop Usher* mentions an old Welsh Chronicle
in the Cottonian Library, that formerly was in the possession
of that learned antiquary, Humphrey Lhwyd, which he says
is thought to be that which Goffrey translated. But if that
be the original manuscript, it must be acknowledged that
Geoffrey was not merely a translator, but made some addi·
tions of his own: since, as that most learned prelate informs
us, the account that we have in this History of the British
Flamma, and Archflamens, is nowhere to be found in it.
But besides this, there are several copies of it in the Welsh
tongue, mentioned by the late ingenious and learned Mr.
Lhwyd iu his ‘Archaeologia Britannica? And Ι myself
have met with a manuscript history of our British affairs,
written above a hundred years ago by Mr. J ohn Lewis‚ and
shortly to be published, wherein the author says, that he had
the original of the British History in parchment written in
the British tougue before Geoffrey's time, as he concludes
from this circumstance, that in his book Geoffrey's preface was
wanting, and the preface to his book was the second chapter
of that published by Geoffrey. My ignorance of the Welsh
tougue rendere me unqualified for making any search into
these matters3 and though the search should be attended with
never so much satisfaction, to those who are able to judgc of
the antiquity of manuscripts, yet to the generality of readers,
other arguments would perhaps be more convincing.”

ι The passages which we have here quoted at length, will

give the reader the most ample information concerning the
nature of the question, and it only remains to inform the
reader what is my own opinion on this long-agitated literary
controvers .

Το thosdr who have read the plain and simple statements
of Julius Oaesar and the other classic historians who have
described the early state of Britain, it will be morally certain
that all such accounts as we have in Geoffrey of Monmouth
are purely fabulous. The uncertainty of every thing, save
the bare fact, connected with the siege of Troy, is so great,
that to connect its fortunes with those of a distant and at
that time unheard·of island like Britain, can be admissible
only in the pages of romanoe. But in the latter part of tho
