holy priest, or godly king, they would no doubt receive the
same answer which their father Simon Magus had frum the
mouth of the apostle Peter, saying: ‘⁴ 'Hy money be with
thee unto thy perdition.” But, alasi perhaps they who
order and advanoe these ambitious aspirers, yea, they who
rather throw them under foot, audior a blessing give them
acursing, whilst of sinuers they make them not penitents
(which were more consonant to reason), but sacrilegious and
desperate offenders, and in a sort install dudae, that traitor
to his Master, in the chair of Peter, and Nicholas, the author
of that foul hcresy, in the seat of St Stephon the martyr, it
may ba at first obtained their own priesthood by the same
means, and therefore do not greatly dislike in their children,
but rather respect the course, that they their fathers did
before follow. And also, if finding resistance, in obtaining
their dioceses at home, and some who severely renounce this
chaffering of choreb-livings, they cannot there attain to suoh

that so, in the end, yea even with tho sale of their whole sub·
statice, they may win and compass such a pomp, and such an
incomparable glory, or to speak more truly, such a dirty and
base deecit and illusion. And afterwards with great show and
magnificent ostentation, or rather medness, returning back to
their own native soil, they grow from stoutneas to stateliness,
and from being used to level their looks to the tops of the
mountains, they now lift up their drowsy eyes into the air,
even to the highest clouds, aud as Novatus, that foul hog,
and persecutor of our Lord's precious jewel, did once at .
Rome, sodo these intrude themselves again into their own
country, as creatores of a new mould‚ or rather aa instru-
ments of the devil, being even ready in this state and fashion
to stretch out violently their hands (not so worthy of the
holy altars as of the avenging flames of hell) upon Christ's
most holy sacrifices.
