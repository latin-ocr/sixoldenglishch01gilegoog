l. Annos, called by chrysostom Great Britain, is, accord·
ing to Caesar, of ahiangular shape, resembling Sicily. One
of the sides lies opposite to Celtic Gaul. One angle of this

side, which is the Cantian promontory,2 is situated to the
east; the other, the Ocrinian promontory,⁸ in the country
oi the Dumnonii, faces the south and the province oi Tarra·
comensis in Spain. This side is about five hundred miles in

2. Another side stretohes towards Irelsnd and the west,
the length of which, according to the opinion oi the ancients,
is seven hundred miles.

3. The third side is situated to the north, and is opposite to
no land except a few islandus but the angle oi this side
chiefly trends towards Germania Magna⁵ The length from
the Novantian Chersonesus,6 through the country oi the
Taixali, to the Cantian promontory,⁷ is estimated at eight
hundred miles. Thus all erroneously compute the circuit of
the island to be two thousand miles3 for from the Cantian
promontory to Oorinum,⁸ the distance is four hundred miles;
from thence to Novantum, athousand3 and from thence to
'he Cantian promontory, two thousand two hundred. The
circumferenoe of the whole island is therefore three thousand
six hundred miles.9

4. Livy and Fabius Rusticus compare the form of Britain
to an oblong shield or battle-axe 3 and as, according to Taci-
tus, it bears that figure on the sideof Caledonia, the compar·
ison was extended to the whole island, though the bold pro
montories at its further extremity give it the shape osa
wedge. But Oaesar and Pomponius Mela assert that its form
is triangular.

culations given by different ancient authors of ahs circus of our island.
On such vagae principles as these estimations are made, it would bs almo!
