, stood the Roman arms, and frequently triumphed over them,
, until he was defeated by Ostorius, as he was preparing to
attach the Romans. Caractacus, however, escaped from the
² battle, and in applying for assistance to the neighbouring
chieitains was delivered up to the Romans, by the artifices of
a Roman metron, Carthismandua, who had married Venutius,
chief of Brigantio. After this defeat the Silures bravely
defended their country till it was overrun by Veranius, and
being finally oonquered by Frontinus, it was reduced into ι
Roman province under the name of Britannia Secunda.

24. Two other tribes were subject to the Silures. First
the Ordovices, who inhabited the north towards the isle of ·
Monte and secondly the Dimetiae, who occupied the west,
where the promontory Ootorupium³ is situated, and from
whence is a passage of thirty miles⁴ to Ireland. The eities
of the Dimetiae were Menapia⁵ and Maridunum⁶ the metro·
polis. The Romans seiaed upon Lovantium⁷ as their station.
Beyond these, and the borders of the Silures, were the
Ordovices, whose cities were Mediolanum⁸ aud Brenno-
genium.⁹ The Sabrina, which rises in their mountains, is
juetly rechoned one of the three largest rivers of Britain,
the Thamesis (Themes) and the Tavus (Tay) being the
other two. The name of the Ordovices is first distinguished
in history on account of the revenge which they took sor
the captivity of their renowned chief. Hence they con·
tinually harassed the Roman army, and would have suooeeded
in annihilating their power, had not Agricola turned hither
his victorious arms, subdued the whole nation, and put the
greater part to the swerd.

25. The territory situated north of the Ordovices, and
washed by the ocean, was formerly under their dominion.
These parts were certainly inhabited by the Cangiani, whose
chief city was Segontium,l near the Gangian promontory,²
en the Minevian shore, opposite Μοιιιι,3 an island long
distinguished as the residenee of the druids. This island
contained many towns, though it was scarcely sixty miles in
- circuit3 and, as Pliny asserta, is distant from the colony of
