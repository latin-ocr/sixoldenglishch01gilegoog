Lord in this life, will fall down into the miserable prison of
hell?

S 110. Neither yet let any priest flattu himself upon tir·
knowledge of the particular cleanness of his own body, since
their souls (over whom he bath government) shall ιιι the day
of judgment be required at his hands as the murderer of
them, if any through his ignominae, aleth, or fawning adula-
tion, have periehed, because the stroke of deam rs not less
terrible, that ιι given by a good man, than that which ιι in·
flicted by an evil pers0n; otherwise would the apostle never
heve said that which he lest unto his successore, as a fatherly
legacy, “Iam clear and clean from the blood of all: for 1
have not ferborne ιο declare unto you all the ceunsel of
Godss’ Being therefore mightily drunken with the use and
custom of sins, and extremely overwhelmed with the waves
(as it were) of increasing offences, seek ye now forthwith the
uttermost endeavours of your minda (after this your ship-
wreck)‚ that one plank of repentance which is leh, whereby
ye may escape and swim to the land of the living, thet from
you may bc turned away the wrath of our Lord, who saith,
“ I will not the death of a sinuer: but that he may be con·
verted and live.'' And may the same Almighty God, of all
consolation end mercy, preserve his few good pastore from
all evil, and (the common enemy being overcome) make them
free inhabitants of the beavenly city of Jerusalem, which is
the congregation of all saints; grant this, Ο Esther, Son,
aud Holy Ghost, ιο whom be honour aad glory, world with-

out end Amen.
