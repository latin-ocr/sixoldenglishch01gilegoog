'l'heppersou who especially gave this eeunsel was Vurlh·
ern‚* who at that time was king over all, and to him all tho
nobility asserted. They preferred to procure assistance to '
them from Germany. Already two young men, Hengist
and Horsa, were pre-eminent. They were the grandsons
of woden, king of the barbarians, whom the pagens have
since raised to an abominable dignity, and honouring him as
a god, offer sacrifice to him for the sake of victory or valour,
and the people, deceived, believe what they see, as is their
went. The aforesaid youths therefore arrive, aeeording to
the petition of the king aud his senate, with three vessels,
loaded with arms, and prepared with every kind of warlika
stores: the anchor is cast into the sea, and the ships eume to
land. Not long afterwards they are sent against the Seots
to try their mettle‚ and without delay they sheathe their
breasts iu arms, and engage in a novel mode of battle. Man
elashes with man, now falls a German and now a scot: ou
both sides is a most wretched scene of slaughter: at length
the Saxeus remain masters of the field. For this the king
aforesaid honours them with a triumph3 and they privately
send home messengers‚ to tell their countrymen of the fer·
tility of the country and the indolence of its cowardly people.
Their countrymen, without delay, listen to their representa·
tions, and send to them a large fleet and army. Forthwith
they were magnificently received by the king of the Britons,
and contracted a league of hospitality with the nativas. The
Britons promise peace, worthy gifts of alliance and honours,
provided that they might romain in ease under their protec-
tion from the attacks of their enemies, and pay them im·
mense stipenda.

Thus much of the allianoe and promises of the Britoust
now let us speak of their diseord and ill fortune. For seeing
the cunningness of the new people, they partly feared and
partly despised them. They break their eompact, and no
longer render them the honours of alliance, but instead
thereos, they try to drive them from their shores. These
being their designa the thing is made public, the treatyis
openly set asida, all parties fly to arms: the Britons give
