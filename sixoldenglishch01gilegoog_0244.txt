Ar these words of Merlin, Aurelius burst into laughter, and

They are mystical stones, and of a medicinal virtue. The
giants of old brought them from the farthest coast of Africa,
and placed them in Ireland, while they inhabited that coun-

they should be taken with any illness. For their method ’

chose also Merlin himself, by whose direction the whole
affair was to be managed. A fleet being therefore got
ready, they set sail, and with a fair wind arrived in Ire·
land.

so great a devastation in the island of Britain, when the
Britons are such brutes and fools. Was ever the like folly
