themselves into two bodies, and began to prepare defences,
for they had two kings and many earls, so they gave the
middle part of the army to the two lainga, aad the other
part to all their earls. Which the Christiane perceiving,
divided their army also into two troops, and'also began to
construet defences. But Alfred, as we have been told by
those who were present, and would not tell aa untruth,
marehed up promptly with his men to give them battle;
for king Ethehed remained a long time in his tent in prayer,
hearing the mass, and said that he would not leave it, till
the priest had done, or abandon the divine protection for
that of men. And he did so too, which afterwards availed

seen it. Aronnd this trae the opposing armies came to
gether with loud shouts from all sides, the one party to
pursue their wicked course, the other to fight for their lives,
their dearest ties, and their country. And when both armies
had fought long and bravely‚ at last the pagane, by the di.
vine judgment, were no longer able to bear the attacks of
the Christians, and having lost great part of their army,
took to a disgraceful ssight. One of their two lainga, and
