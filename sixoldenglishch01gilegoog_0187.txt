-tp many engagementa went to Rome, and solicited the
senate for leave to defend with a lieet tho maritime coasts ol
Britain, from the incursione of barbarians3 which ii they

would grant him, he promised to do more ior the honour and
service of the commonwealth, than by delivering up to them
the kingdom of Britain. The senate, deluded by his specious
promises, granted him his request, and so, with his commis·
sion scaled, he returned to Britain. Then hy wicked prac-
tices getting a fleat together, he venlisted into his service a
body of the brevest youths, and putting out to sea, sailed
rpund the whole kingdom, causing very great disturbanoe
among the people. In the meantime he invaded the adjacent
islands, where he destroyed all before him, countries, cities,
and towns, and plundered the inhabitants of all they had.
By this conduct he encouraged all manner of dissolute follows
to llock to him iu hope of plunder‚ and in a very short time
was attended by an army which no neighbouring prince was

oble to oppose. This made him hegin to swell with pride, .

and to propose to the Britons, that they should make him
their king ς sor which consideration he promised to kill and
banish the Romans, and free the whole island from the inva-
sions of barbarous nations'. Accordingly obtaining his re-
quest, he fell upon Bassianus and killed him, and then took
upon him the government of the kingdom. For Bassianus
was betrayed by the Picts, whom Fulgenius his mother's
brother had brought with him into Britain, and who being
corrupted by the promises and presents of Carausius, instead
,of assistiug Bassianus, deserted him in the very battle, and
fell upon his men ; so that the rest were put into a consterna-
tion, and not knowing their friends from their foes, quickly
gave ground, and left the victory to Carausius. Then he, to
reward the Picts for this success, gave them a habitation
in Albania, where they continued afterwards mixed with
the Britons.
