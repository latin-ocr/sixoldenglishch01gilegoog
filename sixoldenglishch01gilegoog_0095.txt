God’s mercy. that 11 his boundleas clemency he would ex·
change the tormenta 01 the malady which then afflicted him
101 some other lighter disease; but with this condition, that
such disease should not show itself outwardly in his body,
lest he should be an object 01 contempt, and less able 10

benefit mankind 3 101110 had great dread 01 leprosy or blind·
ness, or any such complaint‚ as makes men useless or con
temptible when it afflicta them. When he had finished his
prayers, he proceeded 011 his joumey, and not long after he
felt within him that hythe hand 01 the Almighty he was
healed‚ according to his request, 01 his disorder‚ and that it
was entirely eradicated although he had first had even this
complaint in the flower 01 his youth, by his devout and pious
prayers and supplicatione to Almighty God. For 11 lmay
be allowed to speak briefly‚ but 111 0 somewhat preposterous
order, 01 his zealous piety 10 God, in the flower 01 his youth,
before he entered the marriage state, he wished to strengthen
his mind in the observance 01 God's commandments, lor he
perceived that he could with difficulty abstain from gratifying
his carnal desires3 and, because he seared the anger 01 God,

churches and at the relics 01 the saints. There he prostrated
himself on the ground, and prayed that God in his mercy
would strengthen his mind still more in his service by some
infirmity such as he might bear, but 1101 such as would .

and when he had often prayed with much devotion 10 this
effect, 01101 an interval 01 acme time, Providence vouohsafed
10 afflict him with the above-named disease, which he bore
long and painfully 101 many years, and 01011 despaired 01
life, until he entirely got rid 01 11 by his prayers; but, sad
to say! it was replaced, as we have said, athis marriage by
another which incessantly tormented him, night and day,
lrom the twentieth to the sorty-fourth year 01 bis life. But
11 0101, by God's mercy, he was relieved 110111 this infirmity
101 0 single day 01 night, yet the 1001 and dread 0111101
dreadful malady never 1011 111111, but rendered him almost
ydriselesa as he thought, sor every duty, whether human or
11110.
The sons and daughters, which he had by his wife 011010
mentioned were Etlellled the eldest, 01101 whom came Ed·
