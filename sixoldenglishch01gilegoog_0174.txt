whieh the Romans had made through them just before, what
with the furious irruption of their own oountrymen, they
were no longer able to stand their ground, but were obliged
with their broken forces to quit the field Near the plnoe
stood a rooky mountain, on the top of which was a thick
hezel wood. Hither Cassibelhun fied with his men nster he
found himself worsted3 aud having olimbed up to the top of
the mountain, bravely defended himself and hilled the

sent a message to Androgeus to mehe his peace with Julius,
lest the honour of the nation might suffer byhis being taken
prisoner. He lihewise represented to him, that he did not
deserve to be pursued to death for the annoyanoe which he
had given him. As soon as the messengers had told this to
Androgeus, he made answer :-“ That prinae -deserves not
