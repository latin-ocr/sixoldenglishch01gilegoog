these admonitione of the king were either not fulfilled, or
were begun late at the moment of necessity, and so ended
less to the advantage of those who put them in execution3
for I will say nothing of the castles which he ordered to be
built, but which, being begun late, were never finished, because
the hostile troops broke in upon them by land and sea, and,
as often happened, the thwarters of the royal ordinances re·
