king oi the West-Saxone, Humbert, bishop of the East·
Angles‚ anointed with oil and consecrated as king the glo-

rious Edmund‚ with much rejoicing and great honour in the
royal town called Burva‚ in which at that time was the royal
seat, in the fiiteenth year olbis age, on a Friday, the twenty-
fourth moon, being Chrismas-day.

In the year of our Lord's incarnation 860, which was the
twelith of king Alfred's age, died Ethelbald, king of the
West-Saxone, and was buried at Sherbome. His brother
Ethelbert, as was fitting, joined Kent, Surrey, and Sussex
also to his dominion.

In his days a large army of pagana carne from the sea.
and attacked and destroyed the city of Winchester. As they
were returning laden with booty to their ships, Osric,
carl of Hampshire‚ with his men, and earl Ethelwulf‚ with
theman of Berkshire‚ confronted them bravely; a severe

all the eastern coast of Kent. ’

In the year of our Lord's incarnation 866, which was the
eighteenth of king Alfred, Ethelred‚ brother of Ethelbert‚
king of the West Saxons, undertook the govemment of the
kingdom for five years; and the same year a large fleet of
pagans came to Britain from the Danube, and wintered in the
kingdom of the Eastern-Saxons‚ which is called in Saron
East-Anglia; and there they became principally an army of
cavalry. But, to speak in nautical phrase, I will no longer
