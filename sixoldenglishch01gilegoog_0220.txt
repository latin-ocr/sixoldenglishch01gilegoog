made, he retired into the parts 01 Cambria, 1101 knowing
what to do against so barbarous a people.

Ar last he had recourse to magicians 101 their advice, and
commanded them to tell him what course to take. They
advised him to build a very strong tower for his own safety,
since he had lost all his other fortified places. Accordingly
he made a progress about the country, to find out a conve·
nient situation, and came at last to Mount Erir‚ where ha
assembled workmen 110111 0010101 countries, aud ordered them
to build the tower. The builders, therefore, began to lay
the foundation; but whatever they did one day the earth
swallowed up the next, so aa to leave 110 appearance 01 their
work. Vortigern being informed 01 this again consulted
with his magicians conceruing the cause 01 it, who told him
that he must find out a youth that never had afather, and
kill him, and then sprinkle the stenes and cernent with his
blood 3 101 by those means, they said, he would have a firm
foundation. Hereupon messengers were despatched away
over all the provinces, to inquire out such a man. In their
travels they came to a city, called afterwards Kaermerdin,
where they saw some young men, playing before the gate,
and went up to them3 11111 being weary with their joumey,
they sat down in the ring, to see if they could meet with
what they were in quest 01. Towards evening, there hap·
pened on a sudden a quarrel between two 01 the young men,
whose names wera Merlin and Dabutius. In the dispute,
Dabutius said to Merlin: “You 1001, do you presume 10
quarrel with mei Is there any equality in our birth? I am
descended 01 royal rece, both by my father and mother’s side.
As for you, nobody knows what you arc, l'or you neverhad a
father.’' At that word the messengers looked earnestly upon
Merlin, and asked the by-standers who he was. They told
him, it was not known who was his father3 but that his
mother was daughter to the king 01 Dimetia, and that she
lived iu St. Pcter’s church among the uuus of that city.
