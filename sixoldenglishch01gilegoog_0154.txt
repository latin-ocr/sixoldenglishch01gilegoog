Wmn Belinus was thus reigning in peace and tranquillity,
his brother Brennius, who (as we said before) was driven
upon the coasts of Gaul, suffered great torments of mind.
For it was a great affliction to him to be banishsd from his
country, and tc have no power cf returning to retrieve his

loss. Being ignorant what course to take, he went among
the princes oi Gaul, accompanied only with twelve men3 and
when he had related his misfortune to every one of them, but
could procuro assistance from none, he went st last to Segi·
nus, dulre of the Allobroges, from whom he had an honour
able reception. During his stay here, he contracted such an
intimacy with the duke, that he became the greatest favonrite
in the court. For in all affairs, both of peace and war, he
shewed a great capacity, so that this prinae loved him wit'n
a paternal affection. He was besides of a graceful aspect,
tall and slender in stature, and expett in hunting and fowling,
as became his princely birth. So grem was the friendship
between them, that the duke resolved to give him his only

so then without farther delay the marriage was solemnized,
and the princes of the country paid their homage to him, as
the successor to the throne. Scarcely was the year at an
end before the dukedied3 and then Brennius took his oppor-
tunity of engaging those princes oi the country iinnly in his
interest, whom before he had obliged with his friendship.
