quence of 1116 perverse deeds of the aforesaid king; 1161 was
any part of his kingdom left to him except one province only,
named Hamptonshire [Hampshire]. And he remained thereno
long time; for, instigated by an old affront, he slew a certain
duke, and Cynewulf drove him into the wilds of Andr-ed:

A. 755. These things having been premised, Cynewulf ire·
quently fought no slight battles against the Britons. For

Wigferth the knight. They found the prince in the house,
where their master was lying dead. The doors are 116166-
