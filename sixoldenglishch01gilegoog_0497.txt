who fought two and thirty battles with the enemy, and added
ιο the Roman empire two very powerful nations, with their
kings, twenty cities, and the isle of Vecta, contiguous to
Ι Britain. He overcame the remainder by means of Oneas

Sentius and Aulus Plautius. For these exploits he obtained
agreat triumph

5. To him succeeded Ostorius Scapula, aman famous in
war, who reduced the nearest part of Britain into a province,
and added the colony of the veterane, Camulodunum. Cer·
tain cities were delivered up to the chief Cogibundus, who,
according to Tacitus, remained faithful till the accession of
Trajan to the empirc.

6. Avitus Didius Gallus kept possession of what his pre·
decessore had acquired, a few posts only being removed fur·
ther into the interior, in order ιο obtain the credit of extend·

7. Didius Verennius, who succeedcd, died within a year.

8. Suetonius Paulinus continued prosperous for two years.
-The tribes being reduced and garrisons established, he
attached the isle of Mona, because it gave succour to the
rebellious and affcrdedoppcrtunities for invasion. For the
absence of the governor removing all fear, the Britons began
to recover courage, and rose in arms under the conductos

Bonduica, a woman of royal descent Havingreduced the
troops scattered in the garrisons, they attached the colony*
itself, as the seat of slavery, and in the height of ruge and
victory, exercrsed every species of savage barbarity. Had
not Paulinus, on receiving the intelligenoe, luckily hastened
ιο orush the revolt, Britain must have been lost. But tha
fortune of one battle restored it to its former submissior

Many of the natives, from the consciousness of their defeo·

9. Suetonius, in other respecta an illustrious man, but
arrogant to the vanquished and prompt to avengc his own
injuries‚ being likely to exeroise severity, he was replaced by
Petronius Turpilianus, who was more merciful, a stranger to
the offences of the enemy, and therefore more likely to be
softened by their repentance. Having settled the distur-
bances, he gave up the province to Trebellius Maximus.
