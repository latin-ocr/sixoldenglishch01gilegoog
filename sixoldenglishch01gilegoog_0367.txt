delivered tham orer to darkness. “Let‚ therefore, his por-
tion be accursed from the earth; let his plantiugs bring forth
witherings; let him for this be rewarded according to his
dealings3 let every wicked man like the unsound wood be
broken in pieoes. For arising in his wrath hath he over·
thmwn the impotent. Wherefore truly shall he have uo
trust of his lifer when he shall begin to grow disaased‚ let
him not hope for health, but fall into languishing. For his
pride hath been the hurt of many, and he is become decayed
and rotten, as the mallows in the scorohing heat, or as the

ear of corn when it falleth off from its stubble.” And after- ’

wards, ‘⁴ If his children shall be many, they shall be turned
to the slaughter, and if he gather together silver as if it were
earth, and likewise purify his gold as if it were dirt, all
these same shall the just obtain.”

predia of the divine law, threateneth in his discourse. “Thus
saith our Lord God: My right hand shall not be sparing
upon sinnam, neither shall the sword cease over them who
spill the innocent blood on the earth. Fire shall proceed
lrom ont oi my wrath, and devour the foundations of the
earth, and sinnars as if they were inflamed straw. Woe be
unto them who offend, and observe not my commandments,
saith our Lord, I will not for-bear them. Depart from me ye
apostatizing children, and do not pollute my sanctuary. ‘God
doth know who offend against him, and he will therefore
deliver them over to death and to slaughter. For now have
many evils passed over the round compass of the earth. A
sword of lire is sent out against you, and who is he that
shall restrain it? shall any man repulse a lion that hungereth
in the woodi or shall any one quaneh out the fire when the
straw is burning? our Iord God will send ont evils, and who
is he that shall repress them? and fire will pass forth from
out of his wrath, and who shall extinguish iti it shall
brandishing shine‚ and who will not fear it? it shall thunder‚
and who will not shake with dread? God will threaten all,
and who will not be terrified? before his face the eamh
doth tremble, and the foundations of the sea shake from the
de ths.”
