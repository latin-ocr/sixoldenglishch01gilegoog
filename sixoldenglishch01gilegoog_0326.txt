ommitted, is found an innate, indelible, and irremediable
load of folly and inconstancy ?” “ What, wretched man(1
say to myself) is it given to you, as if you were an illustrious
and learned teacher, to oppose the force of so violent a
torrent, and keep the charge committed to you against such
a series of inveterate crimes which has spread far and wide,
without interruption, for so many years? Hold thy peace t
to do otherwise, is to tell the foot to see, and the hand to
speak. Britain hus rulers, and she has watchmen: why dost
thou incline thyself thus uselessly to prate ?'’ She has such,
I say, not too many, perhaps, but surely not too few: but,
because they are bent down and pressed beneath so heavy a
burden, they have not time allowed them to take hreath.
My senem, therefore, as if feeling a portion of my debt and
obligation‚ preoooupied themselves with such objections, and
with others yet more strong. They struggled, as I said, no
,short time, in a fearful strait, whilst 1 read, “There is a time
for speaking, and a time for keeping silence.'’ At le'ngth,
tho creditore side prevailcd and bore off the victory: if
(said he) thou art not hold enough to be marked with the
comcly mark of golden liberty among the prophetic creatures,
who enjoy the rank as reasoning beings next to the angels,
refuse not the inspiration of the understanding ass, to that
day dumb, which would not carry forward the tiara’d magi·
cian who was going to curse God's people, but in the narrow
pass of the vineyard crushed his loosened foot, and thereby
felt the lcsh; and though he was, with his ungrateful and
furious hand, against right justice, beating her innocent
sides, she pointed out to him the heavenly messenger holding
the nfilkneldfword, and standing in his way, though he had not
seen .

Wherefore in zeal for the house of God and for his holy
law, constrcined either by the reasonings of my own thoughts,
or by the pious entreaties of my hrethren, Ι now discharge
the debt so long exacted of me; humble, indeed, in style,
but faithful, as I think, and friendly to all Christ's youthful
soldiers‚ but severe and insupportable to foolish apostates3
the former of whom, if Ι am not deceived, will receive the
same with tears flowing from God’s love; but the others with
sorrow, such as is extorted from the indignation and pusil-
hnimity of a convicted conscience
