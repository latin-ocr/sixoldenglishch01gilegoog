Το Mutilus, the most eloquent and true handmaid of Christ,
Ethelwerd the patriciam health in the Lordl Ι have re·
eeived, dearest sister, your letter which I longed for, and 1
not only read it with kisses, but laid it up in the treasury of
my beart. Often and often do Ipray the grace of the Most
High to preserve you in safety during this life present, and
after death to lead you to his everlasting mansione. But as
Ionce before briefly hinted to you by letter, I now, with
God's help, intend to begin in the way of annals from the
beginning of the world, and explain to you more fully about
our common lineage and desoent, to the end that the reader’s
task may be lightened, and the pleasure of the hearer may
be augmented, whilst he listens to it. Conoerning the coming
of our first parents out of Germany into Britain, their nurn-
berless wars and slaughters, and the dangers which they en·
-countered on ship-board among the waves of the ocean, in
the following pages you will find a full description. In the
present letter therefore Ihaye written, without perplexity of
style, of our modern lineage and relationship, who were our
relations, and how, and where they came from t as far as our
memory can go, and according as our parents taught us. For
instance king Alfred was son of king Ethelwnlf, from whom

we derive our origin, and who had five sons, one of whom
was king Ethelred* my ancestor, and another king Alfred
