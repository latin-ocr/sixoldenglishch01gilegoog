turned to bitterness, you cannot delen} your country, your
wives, and children, against your enemics? Go on, go on
in your civil dissonamus, httle understauding the saying in
tho Gospel, ‘Every kingdom divided against itself shall he
brought to desolation, and a house divided against itself shall
sall! Since then your kingdom was divided against itself ;
sihce the rage of civil discord‚ and the sumes of envy‚ have
darkened your minds, since your pride would not suffer you
to pay obedience to one king3 you see, therefore, your coun-
try made desolate by impious pagana, and your houses falling
one upon another; which shall he the cause of lasting sor-
. row to your posterity. For the harbarous lionesses shall see
their whelps enjoying the towns, cities‚ and other possessione

of your children; from which they shall be miserably ex· ·

pelled, and hardly if ever recover their former flourishing
state.’'

almost over the whole island, he yielded up the greater part
of lt, called Loegria, to the Saxons, whose villainy had been
the occasion of his arrival. Therefore the remainder of the
Britons retired into the western parts of the kingdom, that

is, Cornwall and Wales3 from whence they continually Ἴ
made frequent and fierco irruptions upon the enemy. The l

struction‚ to the coverts of the woods in wales, carrying ἶ
with them the relics of the saints, for fear the sacred bones 3
of so many holy men of old might be destroyed by the bar· ¹
barians, if they should leave them in that imminent danger, ³

and themselves instantly suffer martyrdom. Many moro
went over in a great ileet into Armorican Britain ; so that
the whole church of the two provinces, Loegn'a and North·
umberland‚ had its conventa destroyed. But these things 1
