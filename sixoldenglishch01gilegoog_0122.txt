which he had got together, to besiege the town, into which
he supposed Brutus had put himself with Antigonus and the

arrived at the walls, and had viewed the situation of the
castle, he divided his army into several bodies, and placed
them round it in different statione. One party was charged
not ιο suffer any of the besieged to go out3 another to turn

those commanda, they laboured with their utmost force to
distress the besieged; and night coming on, made choica ol

with labour, refreshed themselves with sleep.
