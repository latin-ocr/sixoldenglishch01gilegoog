in his own words, and with his additional remarks upon it,
is us follows :-“ The story, as collected from himself Leland,
Bale, and Pitts‚ is that Walter Mapes, olias Calenius, arch-
deacon of Oxford, who flourished in the reign of HenryI,
and of whom Henry of Huntingdon, and other historiens as,
wellas Geoffrey himself, make honourable mention, being a
man very curious in the study of antiquity, and a diligent
searcher into ancient librarios, aud especially after the works
of ancient authors, happened while he was in Armorica to
light upon a History of Britain, written in the British
tongue‚ and carrying marks of great antiquity. And being
overjoyed at it, as if he had found avast treasure, hein a
short time aftercame over to England ; where inquiring fora

Geoffrey, being incredibly delighted with this ancient book,
undertook the translating of it into Latin, which he performed,
with great diligence‚ approving himself, according to Matthew
Paris, a faithful translator. At first he divided it into four
books, written in a plain simple style, and dedicated it to
Robert, earl of Gloucester, a copy whereof is said* to be at
Bennet Collega, in Cambridge, which was never yet pub·

it into eight books, to which he added the book of Merlin's
Prophecies, which he had also translated from British verse
into Latin prose, prefixing to it a praiaco, and a letter
to Alexander, bishop of Lincoln. A great many fabulous
and trifling stories arc inserted in the history: but that was
nothis fault; his business as a translator was to deliret
them faithfully such as they were, and leave them to the
judgment of the learned to be discussed.

“To prore the truth of this relation, and to answer at
once all objections against Gcoffrey's integrity, one needs no·
other argument than an assurance that the original manuscript

are able to judge in agreat measure by the character, or any
