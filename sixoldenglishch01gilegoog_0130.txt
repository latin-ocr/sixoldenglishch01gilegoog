Facu thence, passing the river Malua, they arrived at
Mauritania, where at last, for want of provisions, they
were obliged to go ashore; and, dividiug themselves into
several hands, they laid waste the whole country. When
they had well stored their ships, they steered to the Pinara
of Hercules, where they saw some of those sea monsters,
called syrena, which surrounded their ships, and very nearly

was allowed to do without leave from the prince.) Corineus
answered, that as for that matter there was no occasion for
taking leave; upon which one of them, named imbertus
