brother Aurelius then lay sick at winchester, and was not
able to go himself. When Pascentius, Gillomanius, and the
Saxons heard of it, they highly rejoiced, flattering them·
selvas, that his sickness would facilitate to them the conquest

of Britain. While this occurrence was the subject of the
people's discourse one of the Saxona named Eopa, cameto
Pascentius, and said, “What reward will you give the man
that shall kill Aurelius Ambrosius for you ?” To whom
Pascentius answered, “ Ο that Ι could find a man of such
resolution! Iwould give him a thousand pounds of siIver,
and my friendship for life 3 and if by good fortune I can but

introduced into the king’s presence, he promised to restore
him to his health, if he would but take his potions. Upon
which he had his orders forthwith to prepare one of them,

himself clo'se up, and fall asleep, that the detestable potion
might the better operate. The king readily obeyed his pre·
