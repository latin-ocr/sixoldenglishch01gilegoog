Ὀιεωοωοιο in Joy tor this triumph, returned solemn
thanks to θοᾶς and calling tho compacions of his victory
together, amply rewarded every one of tirum, according as
they had distinguished themselves. -On tho other hand, he
was very much oppressed with grief for his brother Nonnius,
'who lay mortally wounded, and attho very point of death.
For Cesar had wounded him in the encounter, and the blow
which he had given him proved incurable3 so that fisteen
days aster the battle he cieo, and was buried at Trinovan·
tum, by tho North Gate. His funeral ohsequies were per·
formed with regal pomp, and casare sword put into tho
tomb with him, which he had kept possession of, when struck
into his shield in the combat. Tho name of the sword
was Croeso Moru (Yellow Doath), aa being morlai to every
body that was wounded with it.

Arrun this ssight oi* Oaesar, and his arrival on the Gallio
coast, the Gaulo attempted to rebel and throw off his yoke.
For they thought he was so much weakened, that his forces
could be no longer a terror to them. Resides, a general
repert was spread among thom, that Cassibollaun was now
out at sea with avast fleet ιο pursuo him in his ssight3 on
which account the Gaulo, growing still more bold, began to
think of driving him from their comto. Cacsar, aware of
their designo, was not willing ιο engage in a doubtful war
with a flerce people‚ but rather chose to go to all their first
nobility with open treasures, and reconcile them with presente.
To the common peoplo he promised liberty, ιο the dispos-
sossod the restitution of their estates, and to the slaves their
freedom. Thus he that had insulted them before with the
‘fieroeness of a lion, and plundered them of ¹all, now, with
the mildness ofa lamb, fawns on them with submissivo
abject speoohes, and is glad to restore all again. 'l'o these
acts of moannoss he was forced to condescond till 'he had
,merod thom, and was able to regain his lost power. In the
meantme not a day passed without his reflecting upon his
