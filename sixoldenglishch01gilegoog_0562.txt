‘eommander Robinson, whose able work, “The British Fleet,’' was reviewed in these
columns in November, 1894, has now undertaken the editing os a series of handboolss, each
os which will deal with one particular subject connected with that grent creation, the Royal
Navy. our national literature has certainly lacked much in this respect. Such books as
have heretosore been produced have almost invariably been oi a character too scientific and
echnical to be os much use to the general public. ΤΙιε series now being issued is intended to
obviate this deiect, and when completed will forma description, both historica] and actual, of ὼε
Royal Navy, which will not only be of use to the prosessional student, but also be os interest
to all who are concerned in the maintenance and efficiency os the Navy.'-Broad Arrow.

‘The series of nava] handbooks edited by eommander Robinson has made a most bopeiul
beginning, and may be counted upon to supply the growing popular demand t'or information
n regard to the Navy, on which the national existence depends.'- Times. '

‘Messrs¹ Bell's series ol “Royal Navy Handbooks” promises to be a very suocesshrl
enterprise. They are praetiosi and definitely informative, and, th0ngh mant ior ὼε use oi '
persons closely scquninted with their subjects, they are not so discouragingly technioal ss to
he useless to the lay seeker niter tmowledgeJ-Bookm
