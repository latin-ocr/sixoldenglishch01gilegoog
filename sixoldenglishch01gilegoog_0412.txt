found who might much more satisfactorily discharge the
labour thus imposed on me3 Ihumbly entreat my readers,
whose ears I may offend by the inelegance of my words, that
they will fulfil the wish of my seniors, and grant me the
easy task of listening with candour to my history· For
scalam efforts very often fail: but bold enthusiasm, were it
in its power, would not suffer me to fail May, therefore,
candour be shown where the inelegance of my words is in-
sufficient, and may the truth of this history, which my rustic
tongue has ventured, as a kind of plough, to trace out in
furrows, lose none of its influence from that cause, in tha
ears of my hearers. For it is better to drink a wholesome
draught of truth from ahumble vessel, than poison mixed
with honey from a golden goblet

of history which I wished to see romain, This history
therefore has been compiled ‘from a wish to benedt my infe·
riona, not from envy of those who are superior to me, in the
scach year of our Lord’s incarnation, and in the alth year
of Merum, king of the Britons‚ and I hope that tbe prayers
of my betters will be offered up for me in recompence of my
labour. But this is sufficient by way of preface I shall
obediently accomplish the rest to the utmost of my power.

ξ 3. I, Nonnius, disciplo of St Elbotus, have endeavoured to
write some extracts which tbe dulness of the British nation
had cast away, because toachers had no knowledge, nor gave
any informatiou in their books about this island oi Britain
