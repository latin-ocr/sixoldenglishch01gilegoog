Underatanding likewise, that the Romans were gono, never
to return any more, they now, in a more insolent manner
than before, began their devastatione in the island Here·
upon the country fellows upon the battlements of the wella
sat night and day with quaking hearts, not daring ιο stir
from their seete, and readier for flight than making the least
resistance In the meantime the enemies eeased not with
their hooks to pull them down headlong, aud dash the
wretched herd to pieees upon the ground; who gained at
least this advantage by their spoedy death, that they avoided
the sight of that most deplorable calamity, which forthwith
threatened their relations and dearest children. Such was
the terrible vengeance of God for that most wicked madnees
of Maximian, in draiuing the kingdom of all its forces, who,
had they been present, would have repulsed any nation that
invaded them 3 an evident proof of which they gave,¹ by the
vast conquesta they made abroad, even in remote countries ;
and also by maintaining their own country in peace, while
they continued here. But thus it happens when a country
is left ιο the defenee of country clowns. In short, quitting
their high wall and their cities, the country people were forced
again to fly, and ιο suffer a more fatal dispersion, a more
furious pursuit of the enemy, amore cruel and more general
slaughter than before ; and like lambe before wolves, so was
that miserable people torn to pieces by the merciless barba·
niens. Again, therefore, the wretched remainder send lettera
ιο Agitius, aman of great power among the Romans, to this
effect. “To Agitius,* thrice consul, the groans of the
Britons.” And after some few other complaints they add:
“The sea drives us ιο the berbarians, and the barbariam
drive us back to the sea: thus ere we tossed to and fro be·
tween two kinds of death, being either drowned or put ιο
the swords Notwithstanding this most moving addreas,
they procured no relief, and the ambaesadors returning back

iu great heaviness, declared to their countrymen the repulse
which they had suffered.
