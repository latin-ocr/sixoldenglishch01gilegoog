out of respect to our ancestors, who enjoyed the same honour.

The king, at the name of Mercury, looking earnestly upon
them, asked them what religion they professed “We wor-
uhip,'’ replied Hengist, “our country's gods, Saturn and Jupi-
ter, and the other deities that govem the world, but especially
Mercury, whom in our language we call Woden, and to
whom our ancestors consecrated the fourth day of the week,
still called after his name Wodensday. Next to him we
worship the powerful goddess, Frea, to whom they also dedi·
cated the sixth day, which after her name we call Friday.”
Vortigern replied, “For your credulity, or rather ineredulity‚

whether by God's providenee or some other agency, happens
very seasonably for me in my present difficulties. For I am
oppressed by my enemies on every side, and if you will
engage with me in my wers, I will entertain you honourably
in my kingdom, and bestow upon you lands and other pos·
sessions.” The barbarians rcadily accepted his offer, and
the agreement between them being ratified, they resided at
his court. Soon after this, the Pica, issuing forth from
Albania, with a very great army, began to lay waste the
northern parts of the island. When Vortigem had inform·

beyond the Humber. Upon their engaging, the battle
proved very fierce on both sides, though there was but little
occasion for the Britons to exert themselves, for the saxona
fought so bravely, that the enemy, formerly so victorious,
were speedily putto flight.
