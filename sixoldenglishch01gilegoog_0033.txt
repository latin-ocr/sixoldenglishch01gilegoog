way, and tle Saxons keep possession of the country. Again
they send t) Germany, not secretly as before, but by a publio
embassy, as victora are wont to do, and demand reinforoe·
ments. Α large multitude joined them from every province
of Germany3 and they carried on war against the Britons,
driving them from their territorias with great daughter, and
ever remaining masters of the field At last the Britons
bend their necks to the yoke‚ and pay tribute. This migra·
tion is said to have been made from the three provinces of
Germany, which are said to have been the most distin·
guished, namely, from Saxony, Angha, and Giota The

and also the Uuhtii, who took their name from the island
W1hta [Isle of Wight], which lies on the coast of Britain.

Saxony, came the tribes which are still called so among the
English, the East Saxona, South Saxona, and West Saxons3

Middle Anglians, Marciam, and all the race of the Nor·
thnmbrians. Moreover Old Anglia is situated between the
Saxone and J utes, having a capital town, which in Saxonis
called Sleswig‚ but in Danish Haithaby. Britain, therefore,
is now called Anglia [England], because it took the name of
its conquerors: for their leaders aforesaid were the first who
came thence to Britain; namely, Hengist and Horsa, sons of
Wyhrtelsz* their grandfather was Wecta, and their great·
grandfather Withar, whose father was Woden, who also
was king of a multitude of barbarians. For the unbalievers
of the North are oppressed by such delusion that they wor-
ship him as a god even to this day, namely the Danas, ab·
Northmem and the Suevi; of whom Lucan says,

“ Pours forth the yellov Saevi from the Noram

So greatly did the invasion of those nations spread and
increase, that they by degrees obliterated all memory of the “
inhabitsnts who had formerly invited them with gifts. They
