turbances against the king, and infest his countriea For
they were now joining with the Saxons whom Pascentius
had brought over, and sending messengers into Germany sor
the rest. Being therefore attended with a vast army, he in·
vaded the northern provinces, and in an outrageous manner
destroyed all the cities and fortified places, from Albania to
York. At last, as he was beginning the siege cf that city,
Uther Pendmgon came upon him with the whole power of
the kingdom, and gave him battle. The Saxona behaved
with reat gallantry, and, having sustained the assaults of
the Egritons, forced them to fly3 and upon this advantage
pursued them with slaughter to the mountain Damon, which
was as long as they could do it with day-light. The moun·
tain was high, and had a hazel-wood upon the top os it, and
about the middle broken and cavernous rocks, which were a
barbour to wild heasts. The Britons made up to it, and
stayed there all night among the rocks and hezel-bushes.
But as it began to draw towards day, Uther commanded the
consuls and princes to be called together, that he might con·
sult with them in what manner to assault the enemy. Where-
upon they forthwith appeared before the king, who com·
mauded them to give their advice3 and Gorlois, duke of
Cornwall, had orders to deliver his opinion first, out of regard
to his years and great experience. “There is no occasion,”
said he, “ for ceremonias or speeches, while we see that it is
still night: hut thereis for boldness and courage, if you
desire any longer enjoyment of your lise and hberty. The
pagana are very numerous, and eager to light, and we much
inferior to them in number ; so that if we stay till dayhreak‚
we cannot, in my opinion, attack thern to advantage. Come
on, therefore, while we have the favour of the night, let us
go down in a close body, and surprise them in their camp
with asudden assault. There can be no doubt of success,

· if with one consent we fall upon them boldly, while they

think themselves secure, and baveno expectation of our
coming in such a manner.’‘ The king and all that were pre·
sent, were plerued with his advice, and pursued it. For as
soon as they were armed and placed in their ranks, they
made towards the enemies' camp, designing a general assault.
But upon approaching to it, they were discovered by tha
match, who with sound of trumpet awaaed their companions.
