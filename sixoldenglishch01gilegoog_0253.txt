earncst set about this attempt, Iam of opinion, you might
with his advice obtain your wishes.” The king readily be·
lieved what he was so well inclined to, and ordered Merlin,
who was also come to the siege, to be called. Merlin, there·
fore, being introduced into the king’a presence, was com·
manded to give his advice, how the king might accomplish
his desire with respect to Igerna And he, finding the great
anguish of the king, was moved by such excessive love, and
said, “To accomplish your desire, you must make use of
such artsas have not been heard of in your time. lknow
how, by the force of my medicinas, to give you the exact
likeness of Gorlois, so that in all respects you shall seem to
be no other than himself. If you will therefore obey my
prescriptions, I will metamorphose you into the true sem-
blanoe of Gorlois and Ulfin into Jordan of Tintagel, his
familiar friend; andI myself, being transformed into another
shape, will make the· third in the adventure3 and in this
disguise you may go safely to the town where Igerna is, and
have admittance to her.'’ The king complied with the pro·
posal, and acted with great caution in this affair3 and when
he had committed the care of the siege to his intimate
friends, underwent the medical applicatione of Merlin, by
whom he was transformed into the likeness of Gorlois; as
was Ulfin also into Jordan, and Merlin himself into Bricel ;
so that nobody could see any remains now of their former
likeness. They then set forward on their way to Tintagel‚
at which they arrived in the evening twilight, and forthwith
signified to the portet, that the consul was come 3 upon which
the gates were opened, and the men let in. For what room
could there be for suspicion, when Gorlois himself seemed to
be there present ? The king therefore stayed that night with
Igerna, and had the full enjoyment of her, for she was de·
ceived with the false disguise which he had put on, and the
artful and amorous discourses wherewith he entertained her.
He told her he had left his own place besieged, purely to
provide for the safety of her deur self, and the town she was
in ; so that believing all that he said, she refused him nothing
which he desired The same night therefore she conceived
of the most renowned Arthur, whose heroic and wonderful
action have justly rendered his name famous to poetoeity.
