16. It remains now to give some account of those pcopla
who lived in the interior parts. The Corioudii bordered
upon the Cauci and Menapii, above the Brigantes; the
Scotti possessed the remaining part of the island, which
from them took the name of Scotia Among many of their
cities, the remembrance of two only has reached our timess
the one Rheba, on the lake and river Rhebius; the other
Ibernia, situated at the east side of the river Senus.

17. Ι cannot omit mentioning in this place that the
Damnii‚ Voluntii‚ Brigantes, and (langiani were all natione
of British origin, who being either molested by neighbouring
enemim, or unable to pay the heavy tribute eneted of them,
gradually passed over into this country in search of new
settlements. With respect to the Menapii, Cauci, and some
otherpeople, ithae been before remarked that many things
occur which cannot safely be relied upon. Tacitus relates
that Hibernia was more frequented by foreigners than
Albion. But in that case, the ancients would undoubtedly

have lest us a more ample and credible account of this island
’ While I am writing a description of Hibernia, it seems right
to add, that it was reduced under the Roman power, not by
arms, but hy sear: and moreover, that Ptolemy, in his
second map of Europe, and other celebrated geographers,
have erred in placing it at too great a distance from Britain,
and from the northern partos the province Secunda, as
appears from their books and maps.

18. North of Hibernia are the Hebudes, five⁶ in number,
the inhabitants of which know not the use of corn, bnt live
on fish and milk. They are all, according to Solinus, subject
monachici, for they are only divided from each other by
narrow straits. The chief possessed no peculiar property.
but was maintained by general contribution: he was bound
by certain laws; aad lest avariae should seduco him from
equity, he learned justice from poverty, having no house nor
property, and being maintained at the public expense. He
had no wife; but took by turns any woman for whom he
felt an inclination‚ and hence had neither a wish nor hope

⁸ The Hebudes amount to more than five. From hence it may perhaps
be inferred that the Roman fleet in their voyage of discovery did not reach
uae aeas, though they coasmd the northern part of scotland, for ab·
oran· are rightly numbered.
