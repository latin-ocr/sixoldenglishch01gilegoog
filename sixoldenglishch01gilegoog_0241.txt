when he had Agag, king of Amalek, in his power, hewed
him in pieces, saying, As thy sword hath made women child-
less‚ so shall thy mother be childless among women. Do
therefore the same to Hengist who is a second Agag.”
Accordingly Eldol took his sword, and drew him out of th

city, and then cut off his head. But Aurelius, who showed
moderation in all his conduct, commanded him to be buried,
and a heap of earth to be raised over his body, according tc
the custom of the pagens. ·

tarily to the children of Israel to desire mercy, and they
obtained it. And shall we Christians be worse than the
Jews, in refusing them mercy? Itis mercy which they beg,
and let them have it. The island of Britain is large, and in

them, and suffer them at least to inhabit the desert places,
that they may be our vassals for ever.” The king acquiesced
