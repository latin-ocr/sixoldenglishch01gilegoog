As it rs fifty· one measured miles from London ιο Οοιιιιιιιιι, ιιιιιιιιι
ιι prohable that the stone from whence the Roman miles were meaeured
wnsat least one mile west οι Wbitechapel church, we cannot allow any
material deviation from the course οι ιιι ριιιιιιι rond, except ιιι the
neighbourhood of the capitul, where the Roman rond, instead of passing
through Mile End, went much straighter over the Lee ιιι Old Ford, and
sen again into the course ol the present tumpihe ιι stratford The Itine-
rnry allowing only fifty· ·two miles between London and Colohester, and the
fifth Iter of Antonine agreeing with this οι Richard, hy stating twenty·
eight as the distance between London and casaromaym, we may implicitly
adopt the distances here giren, and fix the intermediate staticus near Rum-
ford, Chelmslord, and Kelvedon. From Colchester the road ran to the
διοιιι, where probably stood tha Mansio ad Ansam. From hence ιο Cas·
ιοι, near Norwich, (the Vento Icenorum ,) the statione and course οι the

,. rond are unknown. Some commentatore have supposed ιι ran westerly, by
Brettenham and Τιιιιιοιιις others by I pswich, Stowmarlret and Scole
ln..; and others have carried it more ιιιιιιιγ ‚by Ipswich and Βιιιιι rurgh,
or Ιιιιιιιιιιιι, ιο ιιι capital οι the Iceni. In ιιιοιιι οι the first, therela
merely the ιιιρροιιιι resemblance ol the name οι Βιιιιιιιιιιιιιι ιο Cambr re
ιιιιιιιιιιι οι the second, traces of a Roman way, called thePy eRoad; and
of ιιιιι third, a British traci-way, and another Roman ιοιιι, called the
Stone Street. But the distances suit none οι these sites, and no Roman
remains have any where been found, between the Stour and Castor, suffr·
cient ιο justily an alteration οι the numerals.

Ιιῐιιιιιιι may have been Icklingham; end Oombortoam was most pro-
bably ιι Cambridge, from whence there is aRoman road discoverable ιο
Lincoln. To the first statim, Godmanchester, this Iter goes οιι ιιι great
communication between Colchester and chester, which for the sake of dis- -
tinction nray be called the Vra Decem and from Godnranchester to Lin-
coln, on the eastern branch οι tha Ermyn Street, which wus adopted by
the Romans. Twenty miles from Godmnnchester, we find the great station
ol Chesterton, on one side of the Neu, and Castor on the other; which
probably gave nise ιο the two names οι Durobrivae, and Duniomcpun the
Roman and British towns severally notioed by ιιιιιοιιιιιι and Richard.
About twenty· ·five miles further, ιιι ιιιι course οι the rosd which cannot be
mistaken, we find Ancasten the Ιιιιιιιιι Cosmum, or damnent th·
cinerarios, from whence twenty· one additional nu'les bring ιιι ιο Ιιιιιν
