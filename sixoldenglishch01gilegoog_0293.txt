this assault which they made m conjunctior with Hoel and
Walgan, there was not an enemy within their reach that
could escape the fury of their sword or lance. But upon
their falling in among Lucius’s party, they were surrounded
s by them, and suffered the same fate with the consul and the
other men. The loss of these men made those matchless
heroes, Hoel and Walgan, much more eager to assault the
general’s ranks, and to try on all sides where to make the

The fight continued between them a long time, with great
force of blows, and no less dexterity in warding them off,
each being resolved upon the other's destruction. During·
this sharp conflict between them, the Romans, on a sudden,
recovering their coinage, made an assault upon the Armori-
cana, and having relieved their general, repulsed Hoel and
Walgan, with their troops, till they found themselves
unawares met by Arthur and the forces under him. For
