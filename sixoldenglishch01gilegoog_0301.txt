Arrun Malgo succeeded Careticus, a lover of civil war, and
hateiul to God aud to the Britons. The Saxone, discovering
his fickle disposition, went to Ireland for Gormund, king of
the Africana, who had arrived there with a very great
ficet, and had subdued that country. From thence, at
their traitorous instigation, he sailed over into Britain,
which the perfidious Saxone in one part, in another the
Britons by their continual wars among themselves were
⁴ wholly laying waste. Entering therefore into allianoe
with the Saxons, he made war upon king Careticus, and
after several battles fought, drove him from city to city, till
at length he t’orced him to Oirecester, and thero besieged
him. Here Isembard, the nephew of· Lewis, king of the
Franks, came and made a league of amity with him, and out
of respect to h1m renounced the Christian saith, on condition
that he would assist him to gain the kingdom of Gaul from
his uncle, by whom, he said, he was forcibly and unjustly
expelled out of it At last, after taking and burning the
city, he had another fight with Careticus, and made him fiee
beyond the Severn into Wales. He then made an utter
devastation of the country, set fire to theladjacent cities,
and continued these outragei until he had almost burned
up the whole suriace oi the island from the one sea to
the other3 so that the tillage was everywhere destroyed,
and a general destruction made of the husbandmen and
clergy, with fire and sword. This terrible calamity caused
the rest to fiee whithersoever they had any hopes oi
safety.
