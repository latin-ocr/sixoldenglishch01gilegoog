priests, who serve the altar, because the fields have been
made miserable. Let the earth mouth, because corn hath
become miserable and wine been dried up, oil diminished,
aud husbandmen withered away. Lament ye possessione, in

ished 3 the pomegranates, and palm, and apple, and all trees
of the field are withered away, in respect that the childoen
of meu have consounded their joy.” All which things are
spiritually to be understood by you, that your souls may not
wither away with so pestilent a famine, for wantos the word
of God. And again, “ Weep out ye priests, who serve our
Lord, sayiug, Spare, Ο Lord, thy people, and give not over
thine inheritance ωηο reproacb, and let not natione hold
domiuiou over them, that Gentiles may not say, Whereis
their God?'‘ And yet ye yield not your ears ωηο these

§ 84. Wityh diligence also atteyud ye what holy Hosea the¹
prophet hath spoken ωηο priests of your behaviour. “ Hear
these words, Oye priests, aud let the house of Israel, toge-
ther with the king’s house, mark them3 fasten ye them in
your ears, for ωηο you pertaiueth judgment‚ because ye are
made an entangliug snare to the espying watch, and as a net
stretched over the toils which the followers of hunting have
framed.''

ξ 85. Το you also may this kind of alienation from our

savour iu your solemn assemblies, because albeit ye offer
your burnt sacrifices and hosts, I will not accept them, aud
Iwill not cast mine eye ou the vows of your declaration.
Take away from me the sound of your songs, and the psalm
of your organa I will not hear.'’ For the famine of the
evangelioal meat consuming, in your abundance of victuala
the very howels of your souls, rageth violently within you,
according as the aforesaid prophet hath foretold saying,
“Behold, the days shall come, saith our Lord, and 1 will
send out a famine upon the earth3 not the famine of broad,
nor the thirst of water, but a famine in hearing the word
