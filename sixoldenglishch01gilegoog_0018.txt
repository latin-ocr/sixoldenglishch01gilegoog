must confess, that I find the most learned antiquarios tlte
most modest in their opinions concerning it, and that it seems
to meto bea piece of great rashness, to judge peremptorily
upon a matter, whercof atthis great distance of time there
are no competent witnesses cn either side. At least 1 can·
not but think ita sufficient apology for my publishing this
book, to consider only, that though it seems to suffer under a
general prejudice at present, yet it has not long done s03
but that upon its first appearing in the world, it met with
'a universal approbation, and that too, from those who had
better opportunities of examining the truth of it, as there
were then more monuments extant, and the traditione more
fresh and uncorrupted concerning the ancient British affairs,
than any critica of the present age can pretend to; that it
had nc adversary before William of Newburgh about the
end of the reign of Richard the First, whose virulent invec-
tive against it, we are told, procceded from a revenge he

’ thought he owed the Welsh for an affront they had given

him ; that his opposition was far from shaking the credit of
it with our succeeding historiens, who have, most of them,
till the beginning cf the last century, confirmed it with their
testimonies, and copied after it, as often as they had occasion
to treat of the same affairs: that its authority was alleged by
king Edward the First and all the nobility of the kingdom,
in a controversy of the greatest importance, before Boniface
the Eighth; that even in this learned ege, thetis sc indus·
tricus to detect any impostures, which through the credulity
of former times had passed upon the world, the arguments
against this history arc not thought sc convincing, but that
several men of equal reputation for learning and judgment
with its adversaries, have written in favour of it ; that very
few have at last spoken decisively against it, cr absolutely
condemned it ς and that it is still most frequently quoted by
our mcst learned historiens and antiquaries. All these con·
siderations, Ι say, if they dc not amount to an apology for the
history itself, show at least that it deserves to be better

, known than at present it is ; which is sufficient to justify my ·
undertaking the publishing of it.'’

Itis unnecessary in the present day to prove that king
Brute is a shedcwy personage, who never existed but in tha
reglum cf romanco z but as the reader may justly expect to .
