find in this place sorno account of the controversyvvldch has
existed respecting this work, the following remarks will not
be deemed inappropriate. There seems no good reason for
supposing that Geoffrey of Moumouth intended to deceive
, the world respecting the history of which he professed to be

the translator ; and it may be readily conceivod that he did
no more than fulfil the task which he had undertakes,
of rendering the book into Latin out of the original language.
But those wh0, even as late as the beginning of the last
century, supported the authenticity of the history, have
grounded their opinions on such argumentsasthe following :-

1. Thac, upon its first appearance in the world, the book
mot with universal approbation, aud that too from those who
had better opportunities oi' examining the truth of it, as
there were then more monuments extant, and the traditione

ations betray his ignoranca ol tha story.

5. That Ircland, who lived under Henry the Eighth,
Humphrey Lhwyd, Sir John Price, Dr. Caius, Dr. Powel,
and others, have supported the story ol' Brute, etc.

Such arguments may have satisfied the credulous students , ’

ol‘ the seventeenth century, but the more enlightened criti·
cism of the present day will no longer listen to them. It ·

may not, however, be uninteresting to hear the account which
lhompson, the English translator gives of this work, which,
