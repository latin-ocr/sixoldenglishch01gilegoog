for the building of citios, and for rehuilding the walls of
Trinovantum, which he also surrounded with innumerahle
towers. He lihewise commanded the citizens to build
homes, and all other kinds of structores in it, so that no city
in all foreign countries to a great distance round could
show more beautiful peiores. He was withel owarlilre
man, and very magnificent in his feasta and public enter·
tainments. And though he had many other cities, yet hc

part of the year ; for which reason it was afterwards
called Keerlud, and by the corruption of the word, Caer-
london; and again by change of langnnges, in process
of time, London; as also hy foreigners who arrived here, '
md reduced this country under their subjection, it was
called Londres. At last, when he was dead, his body .
was buried by the gate which to this time is called in
the British tongue after his name, Parthlud* and in the
Saron, Ludesgata. He had two sons, Androgeus and
Tenuantius, who were incapable of governing on account
of their age: and therefore their uncle Cmsibellaun was

kingdom came to be invested in him, and not in his
nephews. Notwithstanding Cassihellaun, from an impulse
of piety, would not suffer them to be without ‘their share

ln the kingdom, hut assigned a large part of it to them.
For he bestowed the city of Trinovantum, with the duke-
dom of Kent, on Androgeus ; and the dukedom of Cornwall
on Tenuantins. But he himself, as possessing the crown,
had the sovereignty over them, and all the other princes
