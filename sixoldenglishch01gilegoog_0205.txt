Hammon, alter a consultation together, Guethelin, aroh-
bishop of Loudon, passed over into Lesser Britain, called then
Armorica, or Letavia, to desire assistance of their brethren.
At that timo Aldroen reigned there, being the fourth king
from conara to whom, as has been already related, Maximian
had given that kingdom. Thisprinca seeing a prelate of 10
great dignity arrive, received him with honour, and inquired
aner the occasion os his coming. To whom Guethelin r-

. “Your majesty can be no stranger to the misery which we,
your Britons, have suffered (which may even demand your
tears),-since the time that Maximian drained our island of
its soldierr, to people the kingdom which you enjoy, and
which God grant you may long enjoy in peace. For against
us the poor remains of the British race, all tho people of the
adjacent islamls, have risen up, and made an utter devasta-
tion in our country, which then abounded with all kinds of
riches} so that tho people now are wholly destitute of all
manner of sustenance, but what they can get in hunting.
Nor had we any power or knowledge of military affairs left
among us to encounter the enemy. For the Romans are
tired of us, and have absolutely refused their assistance. So
that now, deprived of all other hope, we come to implore
your clemency, that you would furnish us with forces, and
protect a kingdom, which is of right your own, from the in·
cursions of barbarians. For who but yourself, ought, with-
out your consent, to wear the orown of Constantine and
Maximian, since the right your ancestors had to it is now
devolved upon you? Prepare then your fleer, and go with
me. Behold 1 I dehver the kingdom of Britain into your
bands.”

Το this Aldroen made answer: “ There was a time for·
merly when I would not have refused to accept of the island
of. Britain, if it had been offered me ; for I do not think there
was anywhere a more fruitful country while it enjoyed peace
and tranquillity. But now, since the calamities that have
befallen it, it is become of less velue, and odious both to me
and all other princes. But above all things the power of tho
Romans· was so destructive to it, that nobody could enjoy
any settled state or authority in it, without loss of liberty,
