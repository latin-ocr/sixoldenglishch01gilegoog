text as well as Ι was able, and as closely as could be to the
author's text3 but Ι am by no means certain of having always

Cain. 11.-asssn’sn11²n 01² ALFRED.

Tms work is ascribed, on its own internal authority, to
Aeser, who is said to have been bishop of st. David’s,
of Sherborne or of Exoter, in the time of king Alfred.
Th0ugh most of the public events recorded in this book
are to be found in the Saxon Chroniclc, yet for many
interesting circumstances in the life of our great Saxon
king we are indebted tc this biography alone. But, as if no
part of history is ever to be sree from suspicion, or from
difficulty, adoubt hasbeen raised concoming the authenticity

, of this work* There is also another short neatise called the

Annals of Asser, or the Chronicle of St. Neot, different from
the present: it is published in vol. iii. of Gale and Fell's
Collection of Historians. And it has been suspected by a
living writer that both of these works are to be looked upon
as compilatione of a later date. The arguments upon which
this opinion is founded are drawn principally srom the ab·
rupt and incoherent character of the work before us. But
we have neither time nor space to enter further into this
question. As the work has been edited by Petrie, so has it
been here translated, and thereader, taking it upon its own
merita, will find therein much of interest about our glorious
king, concerning whom he will lament with me that all wo
know is so little, so unsatisfying.
